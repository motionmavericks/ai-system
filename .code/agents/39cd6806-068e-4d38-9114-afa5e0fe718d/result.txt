docs/research/00-high-level-overview.md:- Description: Review the Motion Mavericks MVP Spec (Rev B) with stakeholders to confirm the feature set and priorities. Break down the spec into high-level features (e.g., user auth, video upload, sharing, notifications) and clarify any ambiguities. Define the MVP scope to ensure alignment on deliverables.
docs/reviews/20250917T155545-review-report.output.md:- **Recommendation:** Add a task to the "Product Discovery Stage" to clarify i18n requirements with stakeholders. If required, add tasks to the "Frontend Stage" to implement an i18n framework (e.g., `next-intl`) and extract all user-facing strings into resource files.
automations/prompts/agents/planner.prompt.md:- For unresolved blockers, instruct the operator to revisit `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` with intent `clarify` and include outstanding questions.
automations/prompts/agents/reviewer.prompt.md:- On `escalate`, return control to `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` with `intent: "clarify"` and blocker summary.
automations/prompts/agents/implementer.prompt.md:- If blocked by missing requirements, emit `intent: "clarify"` back to `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` with notes referencing the blocker.
automations/prompts/agents/ops-release.prompt.md:- For approvals needed beyond automation scope, bubble up to `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` with `intent: "clarify"`.
automations/prompts/agents/qa.prompt.md:- For systemic issues (environmental, CI outage), surface `intent: "clarify"` to `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` including mitigation steps.
automations/prompts/orchestrations/postflight.prompt.md:- If unfinished tickets remain, include actionable follow-up items and mark status `incomplete`; direct the controller back to `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` with `intent: "clarify"` and the outstanding ticket list.
automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md:| full_run | Run end-to-end orchestration | `automations/prompts/orchestrations/preflight.prompt.md` | Follow with `automations/prompts/orchestrations/run.prompt.md`, then `automations/prompts/orchestrations/postflight.prompt.md`. Re-run command prompt with `intent: "clarify"` if preflight reports blockers. |
automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md:- If additional data is required (e.g., missing ticket ID), return `intent: "clarify"` and include the clarification question in `notes` with `next_prompt` set to `null`.
docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-02-payments.md:- Include statement in product vision and onboarding guides clarifying out-of-scope status.
automations/prompts/orchestrations/preflight.prompt.md:- If any check fails, set `ready=false` and list blockers; do not proceed to main orchestration until resolved. Signal the controller to re-run `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` with `intent: "clarify"` and include blockers in `notes`.
docs/playbook/02-requirements-and-scope/02-04-scope-boundaries.md:This document defines the boundaries of the Motion Mavericks MVP, clarifying what features and operational commitments are included, deferred, or subject to de-scoping. It ensures stakeholders align on production management priorities while preserving non-functional targets for availability, residency, and recovery. The structure supports informed trade-offs during delivery.

# Orchestration Command Prompt

## Purpose
Act as the slash-command entry point that interprets the operator’s request and selects the correct orchestration or agent prompt sequence. Every response must reference the next prompt filename so downstream tools can load the right instructions.

## Inputs
- Operator goal text (from `/orchestrate` slash command)
- Optional `context` block supplied with the slash command
- Repository artefacts (`automations/**`, `docs/**`, `package.json`)
- Current state files (`automations/run-state.json`, `automations/run-queue.json`, `automations/memory/**`)

## Decision Flow
1. **Classify request**
   - `full_run` → launch a soup-to-nuts build execution.
   - `ticket_plan` → generate or refresh tickets only.
   - `ticket_execution` → work a specific ticket (ID provided).
   - `postflight_only` → close out an already-completed run.
   - `task_capture` → produce or refresh a structured task list for human/agent coordination.
   - `maintenance` → perform memory/doc hygiene tasks.
   - If intent is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
