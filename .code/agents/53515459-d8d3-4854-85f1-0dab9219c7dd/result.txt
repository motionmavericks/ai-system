[2025-09-18T08:18:54] User instructions:
Context: Repository root `/home/maverick/Projects/ai-system`. Memory store under `automations/memory/`. Prompts now require automatic state init before ticket execution.

Agent: Act as the /orchestrator command. Operator request: "run the queue in full." Review updated instructions and state.
Key references:
- Run queue: `automations/run-queue.json` (tickets F-001..F-006 with dependencies).
- Run state auto-init: `automations/prompts/orchestrations/preflight.prompt.md` (auto runs `npm run automation:run-state:init` when missing) and `run.prompt.md`.
- Memory bootstrap expectations: `automations/scripts/memory-bootstrap.mjs` and run prompt notes.
- Agent orchestration blueprint: `automations/docs/agent-orchestration.md`.
- Ensure output JSON sets intent, next prompt (`preflight` for full run), follow-on sequence (run, postflight), and notes covering auto state init, heartbeat, sequential execution with dependency order, memory artefact updates, and loop requirements.

# Orchestration Preflight Prompt

## Purpose
Perform readiness checks before launching an autonomous build run with persistent memory and reinforcement loops. Invoked when `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` chooses `preflight.prompt.md` as the next prompt for a `full_run` intent.

## Checklist
1. Confirm `automations/build-spec.yaml`, `automations/docs/guardrails.md`, and `automations/docs/agent-orchestration.md` exist, are current, and reference the same memory schema version.
2. Ensure `docs/playbook/open-questions.md` has no blockers marked "critical".
3. Verify repository is clean (`git status --short` == empty) or stash changes.
4. Validate memory health: `automations/memory/manifest.json` present, index checksum matches, replay buffer writable, and free disk space ≥2 GB.
5. Confirm required secrets for CI/CD, telemetry sinks, and memory services (if external) are available (list from `automations/docs/ci-bootstrap.md`).
6. Validate tooling versions: Node LTS (>=20.x), pnpm 9+, Next.js 15, Drizzle CLI, Playwright, k6, DSPy CLI installed.
7. Check connectivity to external services (Neon, Vercel, Clerk, Mux, Resend) and memory backends (vector DB/graph store) if integration tests require them.

# Orchestration Run Prompt

## Purpose
Coordinate planner, implementer, reviewer, QA, ops, and knowledge steward agents to execute the full autonomous build cycle for the Motion Mavericks portal, while maintaining persistent memory and closed-loop learning signals. This prompt follows a successful preflight when `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` is processing a `full_run` intent.

## Inputs
- `automations/build-spec.yaml`
- `automations/run-state.json` (create if absent)
- `docs/playbook/**`
- Agent prompt library (`automations/prompts/agents/*.prompt.md`)
- Memory store (`automations/memory/**`) – hybrid index + replay buffer
- Preflight status (must be ready)

## High-Level Flow
1. **Plan Generation** – Invoke Planner with build spec + long-term memory to produce/upsert ticket backlog (`automations/run-queue.json`) and refresh memory embeddings.
2. **Ticket Loop** – While unresolved tickets remain:
   a. Select next ticket with dependencies satisfied; query contextual memory slice.
   b. Spawn Implementer with ticket + memory; collect outputs + execution traces.
   c. Dispatch Reviewer; if `revise`, loop back to Implementer with feedback persisted to memory.
   d. When approved, run QA; on failure, return to Implementer with logs + failure embeddings.

# Agent Orchestration Blueprint

Defines the autonomous workflow that converts the Motion Mavericks playbook into a working MVP. Roles, inputs, prompts, success criteria, and learning feedback loops are codified for controller tooling (e.g. LangGraph, AutoGen, DSPy).

## 1. Roles & Responsibilities

| Agent | Responsibility | Primary Inputs | Required Outputs |
|-------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Planner | Decompose work into ordered tickets, map dependencies | `automations/build-spec.yaml`, playbook sections `02-*`, `04-*`, `05-*`, `18-*` | Ticket plan (YAML/JSON), acceptance criteria, test plan |
| Implementer | Write code, migrations, configuration per ticket | Planner ticket, relevant playbook doc, ADR refs | Git commit/PR draft, code diffs, updated tests |
| Reviewer | Static analysis, enforce guardrails, request fixes | PR diff, `automations/docs/guardrails.md`, lint/test logs | Review report, approval/block decision |
| QA | Run automated suites, capture artefacts | Implementer output, test suites | Test results, failure triage, rerun instructions |
| Ops/Release | Manage env variables, deploy previews, update change log | Planner release ticket, playbook `13-*`, `18-*`, `20-*` | Deployment status, release notes, change log entry |

# Orchestration Command Prompt

## Purpose
Act as the slash-command entry point that interprets the operator’s request and selects the correct orchestration or agent prompt sequence. Every response must reference the next prompt filename so downstream tools can load the right instructions.

## Inputs
- Operator goal text (from `/orchestrate` slash command)
- Optional `context` block supplied with the slash command
- Repository artefacts (`automations/**`, `docs/**`, `package.json`)
- Current state files (`automations/run-state.json`, `automations/run-queue.json`, `automations/memory/**`)

## Decision Flow
1. **Classify request**
   - `full_run` → launch a soup-to-nuts build execution.
   - `ticket_plan` → generate or refresh tickets only.
   - `ticket_execution` → work a specific ticket (ID provided).
   - `postflight_only` → close out an already-completed run.
   - `task_capture` → produce or refresh a structured task list for human/agent coordination.
   - `maintenance` → perform memory/doc hygiene tasks.
   - If intent is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

**Composing JSON orchestration summary**

I'm putting together a JSON response for a full run orchestration that includes intent, next prompt for preflight, follow-on steps, and detailed notes. The notes will cover auto state initialization due to missing run-state, heartbeat status updates via telemetry, strict sequential execution with dependencies, memory artifact updates, multi-agent loop processes with escalation points, and verification for memory bootstrap scripts or manifest presence. This structured JSON will align with the instructions to facilitate downstream automated processing.
