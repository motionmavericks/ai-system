[2025-09-18T07:43:40] User instructions:
Context: Repository root `/home/maverick/Projects/ai-system`. Helpful references: `automations/run-queue.json` lists tickets F-001 through F-006, and `automations/prompts/orchestrations/preflight.prompt.md` defines the initial workflow for full runs.

Agent: Act as the /orchestrator command for this repository. The operator requested: "complete all outstanding tickets." Review the orchestration instructions in `automations/prompts` and the current run queue in `automations/run-queue.json`. Classify the intent, choose the correct next prompt file, outline any follow-on prompts, and return the JSON packet described in the orchestration guidelines. Mention prerequisites or dependencies that the next prompt runner should be aware of.

# Orchestration Preflight Prompt

## Purpose
Perform readiness checks before launching an autonomous build run with persistent memory and reinforcement loops. Invoked when `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` chooses `preflight.prompt.md` as the next prompt for a `full_run` intent.

## Checklist
1. Confirm `automations/build-spec.yaml`, `automations/docs/guardrails.md`, and `automations/docs/agent-orchestration.md` exist, are current, and reference the same memory schema version.
2. Ensure `docs/playbook/open-questions.md` has no blockers marked "critical".
3. Verify repository is clean (`git status --short` == empty) or stash changes.
4. Validate memory health: `automations/memory/manifest.json` present, index checksum matches, replay buffer writable, and free disk space ≥2 GB.
5. Confirm required secrets for CI/CD, telemetry sinks, and memory services (if external) are available (list from `automations/docs/ci-bootstrap.md`).
6. Validate tooling versions: Node LTS (>=20.x), pnpm 9+, Next.js 15, Drizzle CLI, Playwright, k6, DSPy CLI installed.
7. Check connectivity to external services (Neon, Vercel, Clerk, Mux, Resend) and memory backends (vector DB/graph store) if integration tests require them.

# Orchestration Command Prompt

## Purpose
Act as the slash-command entry point that interprets the operator’s request and selects the correct orchestration or agent prompt sequence. Every response must reference the next prompt filename so downstream tools can load the right instructions.

## Inputs
- Operator goal text (from `/orchestrate` slash command)
- Optional `context` block supplied with the slash command
- Repository artefacts (`automations/**`, `docs/**`, `package.json`)
- Current state files (`automations/run-state.json`, `automations/run-queue.json`, `automations/memory/**`)

## Decision Flow
1. **Classify request**
   - `full_run` → launch a soup-to-nuts build execution.
   - `ticket_plan` → generate or refresh tickets only.
   - `ticket_execution` → work a specific ticket (ID provided).
   - `postflight_only` → close out an already-completed run.
   - `task_capture` → produce or refresh a structured task list for human/agent coordination.
   - `maintenance` → perform memory/doc hygiene tasks.
   - If intent is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.

# Orchestration Run Prompt

## Purpose
Coordinate planner, implementer, reviewer, QA, ops, and knowledge steward agents to execute the full autonomous build cycle for the Motion Mavericks portal, while maintaining persistent memory and closed-loop learning signals. This prompt follows a successful preflight when `automations/prompts/orchestrations/command.prompt.md` is processing a `full_run` intent.

## Inputs
- `automations/build-spec.yaml`
- `automations/run-state.json` (create if absent)
- `docs/playbook/**`
- Agent prompt library (`automations/prompts/agents/*.prompt.md`)
- Memory store (`automations/memory/**`) – hybrid index + replay buffer
- Preflight status (must be ready)

## High-Level Flow
1. **Plan Generation** – Invoke Planner with build spec + long-term memory to produce/upsert ticket backlog (`automations/run-queue.json`) and refresh memory embeddings.
2. **Ticket Loop** – While unresolved tickets remain:
   a. Select next ticket with dependencies satisfied; query contextual memory slice.
   b. Spawn Implementer with ticket + memory; collect outputs + execution traces.
   c. Dispatch Reviewer; if `revise`, loop back to Implementer with feedback persisted to memory.
   d. When approved, run QA; on failure, return to Implementer with logs + failure embeddings.

**Preparing JSON output for full run**

I'm organizing how to respond with a JSON object that classifies the intent as a full run to complete all outstanding tickets. I’ll include a summary, the next prompt as preflight, follow-on prompts for run and postflight, and detailed notes covering prerequisites like guardrails, dependencies among tickets, and where to find relevant files. I'll also consider verifying the existence of required spec and doc files before finalizing the output.
