# Automation Dry-Run – Reinforced Flow

## Scenario
- Ticket: `MMP-TEST-001` – Validate instruments for milestone telemetry.
- Run ID: `RUN-TEST` (synthetic).
- Agents exercised: QA, Ops, Orchestrator memory utilities.

## Steps Executed
1. Generated synthetic telemetry payloads under `automations/samples/telemetry/` covering QA and Ops outputs.
2. Aggregated telemetry into memory mirror:
   - `node automations/scripts/collect-telemetry.mjs --input automations/samples/telemetry --run-id RUN-TEST --output automations/memory/telemetry/RUN-TEST/aggregate.json`
3. Validated memory store integrity:
   - `node automations/scripts/memory-validate.mjs`
4. Verified compaction routine (dry-run):
   - `node automations/scripts/memory-compact.mjs --dry-run`
5. Seeded reinforcement traces (planner, implementer, reviewer) under `automations/memory/replay/RUN-TEST/` to exercise `append_trace` expectations.

## Outcome Summary
- Telemetry aggregation ✅ – `automations/memory/telemetry/RUN-TEST/aggregate.json` produced with averaged metrics and reward snapshot.
- Validation ✅ – `memory-validate` confirmed checksum + counts.
- Compaction ✅ (dry-run) – reported canonical checksum `30c2afc5…` with expected counts.
- Replay traces ✅ – planner/implementer/reviewer payloads created for reinforcement loop testing.

## Artefacts
- Aggregated telemetry: `automations/memory/telemetry/RUN-TEST/aggregate.json`
- Console logs stored in `automations/logs` (see session output above).

## Next Actions
- Expand dry-run to include planner/implementer/reviewer simulated traces once ticket planner emits JSON.
- Connect scripts to CI after adding `pnpm` tasks (`automation:memory:validate`, `automation:memory:compact`).
