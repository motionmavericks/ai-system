# Orchestration Command Prompt

## Purpose
Act as the slash-command entry point that interprets the operator’s request and selects the correct orchestration or agent prompt sequence. Every response must reference the next prompt filename so downstream tools can load the right instructions.

## Inputs
- Operator goal text (from `/orchestrate` slash command)
- Optional `context` block supplied with the slash command
- Repository artefacts (`automations/**`, `docs/**`, `package.json`)
- Current state files (`automations/run-state.json`, `automations/run-queue.json`, `automations/memory/**`)

## Decision Flow
1. **Classify request**
   - `full_run` → launch a soup-to-nuts build execution.
   - `ticket_plan` → generate or refresh tickets only.
   - `ticket_execution` → work a specific ticket (ID provided).
   - `postflight_only` → close out an already-completed run.
   - `maintenance` → perform memory/doc hygiene tasks.
   - If intent is unclear, ask for clarification before proceeding.
2. **Select next prompt** using the table below and include the file path in the response. Always provide `next_prompt` as a fully-qualified relative path (e.g. `automations/prompts/orchestrations/preflight.prompt.md`).
3. **Emit execution packet** describing the chosen flow, prerequisites, and follow-up prompts.

| Intent | Description | Primary Next Prompt | Fallback / Follow-up |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| full_run | Run end-to-end orchestration | `automations/prompts/orchestrations/preflight.prompt.md` | If preflight reports `ready=false`, loop until resolved; upon success advance to `automations/prompts/orchestrations/run.prompt.md`, then `automations/prompts/orchestrations/postflight.prompt.md`. |
| ticket_plan | Rebuild or adjust backlog | `automations/prompts/agents/planner.prompt.md` | After planner output, refresh run queue via `automations/prompts/orchestrations/run.prompt.md` step 1. |
| ticket_execution | Execute single ticket | `automations/prompts/agents/implementer.prompt.md` | On completion, chain to `automations/prompts/agents/reviewer.prompt.md`, then `automations/prompts/agents/qa.prompt.md`, `automations/prompts/agents/ops-release.prompt.md`, and `automations/prompts/agents/knowledge-steward.prompt.md`. |
| postflight_only | Wrap up existing run | `automations/prompts/orchestrations/postflight.prompt.md` | If gaps detected, re-run `automations/prompts/orchestrations/run.prompt.md` for outstanding tickets. |
| maintenance | Memory/doc clean-up | `automations/prompts/agents/knowledge-steward.prompt.md` | If structural fixes required, escalate through `automations/prompts/orchestrations/run.prompt.md` for targeted tickets. |

## Output Format
Respond with JSON so the controller can programmatically load the next file:
```
{
  "intent": "full_run|ticket_plan|ticket_execution|postflight_only|maintenance",
  "summary": "<short rationale>",
  "next_prompt": "automations/prompts/...",
  "follow_on": ["automations/prompts/..."],
  "notes": "optional guidance for the operator or subsequent agents"
}
```
- `follow_on` must list the prompts that should run after `next_prompt` if the flow continues without human intervention.
- If additional data is required (e.g., missing ticket ID), return `intent: "clarify"` and include the clarification question in `notes` with `next_prompt` set to `null`.

## Execution Notes
- Always confirm prerequisites before recommending `preflight.prompt.md` or `run.prompt.md` (e.g., memory manifest present, guardrails readable).
- When routing to an agent prompt, include the ticket ID or relevant payload reference in `notes` so the agent has clear context.
- Keep track of state updates: after any agent produces output, update `automations/run-state.json` and advise when to persist telemetry or memory changes.
- Close the loop by signalling when the operator should re-run this command prompt (e.g., after postflight or if new goals arrive).
