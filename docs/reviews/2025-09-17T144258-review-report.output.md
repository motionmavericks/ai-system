# Recommended Additions and Changes

## Executive summary
- The spec provides a comprehensive and well-structured execution plan for the Motion Mavericks MVP portal.
- Key strengths include clear task breakdowns, defined tech stack choices, and integration plans for third-party services.
- Critical risks identified include potential security gaps in share token implementation and lack of explicit data retention/compliance policies.
- Addressing P0 items will ensure a secure, compliant, and scalable MVP launch.

## Top priorities (P0)
- REC-001 — Implement robust share token security with proper expiration and validation
- REC-002 — Define explicit data retention and deletion policies for user content
- REC-003 — Establish comprehensive security audit procedures for third-party integrations

## Detailed recommendations

### REC-001 · Robust Share Token Security
- **Area:** security_privacy
- **Type:** Change
- **Problem:** Share tokens are described as random strings but lack details on secure generation, expiration, and validation. The current approach may allow for token prediction or replay attacks.
- **Recommendation:** Implement time-limited share tokens with cryptographically secure random generation, server-side validation, and automatic cleanup via cron jobs or KV TTL.
- **Impact:** H
- **Effort:** M
- **Risk:** M
- **Dependencies:** Backend implementation, Vercel KV
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Share tokens expire after a configurable time period (e.g., 7 days)
  - Tokens are generated using a cryptographically secure method
  - Server-side validation prevents unauthorized access
- **Notes:** [VERIFY] How are share tokens currently generated and validated?

### REC-002 · Data Retention and Deletion Policies
- **Area:** compliance
- **Type:** Addition
- **Problem:** The spec lacks explicit policies for data retention and deletion, which is critical for compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Recommendation:** Define clear data lifecycle management policies including automatic deletion of videos and user data after a specified period of inactivity or upon user request.
- **Impact:** H
- **Effort:** M
- **Risk:** L
- **Dependencies:** Legal review, Backend implementation
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Data retention policy is documented and approved by legal team
  - Automatic deletion mechanisms are implemented for inactive content
  - Users can request data deletion through the portal
- **Notes:** [VERIFY] What are the legal requirements for data retention in the jurisdictions where the service operates?

### REC-003 · Third-Party Integration Security Audits
- **Area:** security_privacy
- **Type:** Addition
- **Problem:** The spec mentions integrating with several third-party services (Mux, Resend, etc.) but does not outline security audit procedures for these integrations.
- **Recommendation:** Establish regular security audit procedures for all external service integrations, including reviewing their security practices and ensuring secure API usage.
- **Impact:** H
- **Effort:** M
- **Risk:** M
- **Dependencies:** Security team, Vendor management
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Security audit checklist is created for third-party services
  - Regular audits are scheduled and documented
  - Security vulnerabilities in third-party integrations are addressed promptly
- **Notes:** [VERIFY] Are there existing security audit procedures for third-party vendors?

### REC-004 · Video Streaming Performance Monitoring
- **Area:** performance
- **Type:** Addition
- **Problem:** The spec does not define performance targets or monitoring for video streaming, which is critical for user experience.
- **Recommendation:** Define performance benchmarks for video playback (e.g., load time, buffering frequency) and implement monitoring to track these metrics.
- **Impact:** M
- **Effort:** M
- **Risk:** L
- **Dependencies:** Frontend, Ops
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Performance targets for video streaming are defined
  - Monitoring is implemented to track key performance metrics
  - Alerts are configured for performance degradation
- **Notes:** [VERIFY] What are the acceptable performance targets for video streaming?

### REC-005 · Comprehensive End-to-End Testing
- **Area:** testing
- **Type:** Addition
- **Problem:** The end-to-end tests described are basic and may not cover all critical user flows or edge cases.
- **Recommendation:** Expand the Playwright test suite to cover all major user journeys, including negative test cases and edge conditions.
- **Impact:** M
- **Effort:** L
- **Risk:** L
- **Dependencies:** QA, Development team
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Playwright tests cover all major user flows
  - Negative test cases and edge conditions are included
  - Test results are integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- **Notes:** [VERIFY] Are there specific user flows that are not covered by the current test suite?

### REC-006 · Enhanced Observability and Monitoring
- **Area:** observability
- **Type:** Addition
- **Problem:** The spec mentions using Sentry but lacks details on comprehensive logging and monitoring for debugging and performance analysis.
- **Recommendation:** Integrate comprehensive logging and monitoring with Sentry for both frontend and backend, including custom performance metrics and error tracking.
- **Impact:** L
- **Effort:** M
- **Risk:** L
- **Dependencies:** Ops, Development team
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Comprehensive logging is implemented for all critical operations
  - Custom performance metrics are tracked in Sentry
  - Error tracking is configured for both frontend and backend
- **Notes:** [VERIFY] Are there specific observability requirements for the MVP?
