# Motion Mavericks Task Plan â€“ Phase 06 Release & Operations
Generated: 2025-09-18T06:09:28+00:00
Context:
- Prepare the Motion Mavericks MVP for deployment by establishing CI/CD governance, release checklists, resilience drills, and incident management procedures.
- Coordinate human approvals and communication pathways required for production promotion.

## Tasks
| ID | Description | Required Inputs | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria | Owner |
|----|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| R-001 | Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with environments (dev/staging/prod), manual approvals, smoke tests, and artifact retention. | `docs/playbook/13-devops-ci-cd/13-02-cd-and-release-strategy.md`; `docs/playbook/18-release-and-cutover/18-01-release-checklist.md` | Q-007 | Pipeline deploys to staging on merge; production requires approval; smoke suite runs post-deploy; logs retained per compliance. | Agent: Implementer |
| R-002 | Draft and automate release checklist (pre-flight QA, security review, documentation updates, stakeholder sign-off) stored in repo. | `docs/playbook/18-release-and-cutover/18-01-release-checklist.md`; `docs/playbook/20-03-change-log.md` | R-001 | Checklist template committed; enforced via PR template or bot; changelog entry generated each release. | Human: Technical Delivery Lead |
| R-003 | Build rollback automation (Neon point-in-time recover, Vercel rollback, feature flag kill switches) and rehearse drill. | `docs/playbook/18-release-and-cutover/18-04-rollback-plan.md`; `docs/playbook/06-data-model-and-storage/06-04-backup-and-restore.md` | R-001 | Rollback runbook executed within RTO targets; kill switch toggles features; drill retrospective filed. | Human: Reliability Partner |
| R-004 | Conduct resilience drills: Neon outage simulation, Mux failure fallback, notification queue backlog, and incident tabletop. | `docs/playbook/15-performance-and-reliability/15-04-disaster-recovery.md`; `docs/playbook/11-security-and-compliance/11-05-incident-response.md` | R-003 | Drill reports stored; remediation tasks created; incident response contact tree validated. | Human: Reliability Partner |
| R-005 | Establish operations dashboards and on-call escalation paths (PagerDuty schedules, contact matrix, SOP updates). | `docs/playbook/15-performance-and-reliability/15-03-reliability-engineering.md` | R-004 | On-call rota agreed; dashboards bookmarked; escalation test completed; SOP accessible to stakeholders. | Human: Reliability Partner |
| R-006 | Coordinate pilot launch readiness review covering compliance evidence, QA sign-off, support staffing, and go/no-go criteria. | `automations/build-spec.yaml`; `docs/playbook/17-go-to-market-and-legal/17-02-legal-review.md` | R-002,R-004 | Readiness report produced; open risks documented; go/no-go meeting scheduled with decision owners. | Human: Technical Delivery Lead |

## Sequencing & Notes
- CI/CD automation (R-001) precedes governance and resilience tasks; R-004/R-005 ensure operational maturity before launch.
- Maintain alignment with compliance requirements flagged in open questions (penetration testing).

## Follow-Up Signals
- Telemetry: Deployment success/failure rates, mean time to recover in drills, alert acknowledgement times.
- Review: Technical Delivery Lead and Reliability Partner sign off on readiness; Legal/Compliance confirm evidence set.
- Next Re-evaluation: Prior to GTM execution or after major release process change.
