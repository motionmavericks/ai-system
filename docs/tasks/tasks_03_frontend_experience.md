| FE-005 | Implement asset library (upload modal, progress tracker, preview player, permission toggle, share link view). | `docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-05-third-party-webhooks.md`; `docs/playbook/08-frontend/08-04-forms-and-validation.md` | FE-003; B-004 | Upload progress accurate; playback accessible; permission toggles sync with backend; UI handles error states cleanly. | Agent: Implementer |

| FE-008 | Establish design system tokens, component library, and Storybook documentation for shared UI primitives. | `docs/playbook/03-ux-and-design/03-05-design-system.md`; `docs/playbook/08-frontend/08-05-ui-components.md` | FE-001 | Tokens exported; Storybook stories for buttons, cards, tables, modals; visual regression baseline captured. | Agent: Implementer |
| FE-009 | Implement accessibility and localisation features (ARIA, keyboard traps, screen reader labels, locale switch, translation plumbing). | `docs/playbook/08-frontend/08-06-accessibility-a11y.md`; `docs/playbook/08-frontend/08-07-internationalisation-i18n.md` | FE-008 | axe tests pass; manual screen reader checks completed; locale switch updates copy; fallback logic documented. | Agent: Implementer |

## Sequencing & Notes
- Build shell (FE-001) prior to downstream pages; FE-008/FE-009 ensure design system and accessibility compliance before final QA.
- Storybook rollout addresses open question on component documentation timeline.

## Follow-Up Signals
- Telemetry: Track frontend performance metrics (FCP, TTI), task board engagement, share link views via analytics plan.
- Review: Design Lead and Technical Delivery Lead approve UI per personas; Accessibility lead signs off after FE-009.
- Next Re-evaluation: After FE-009 or ahead of QA automation phase.
