## Sequencing & Notes
- Documentation tasks follow engineering completion but must precede pilot kickoff; compliance pack (D-004) influences go/no-go meetings.
- Feedback workflows (D-007) close loop for roadmap planning; coordinate with analytics instrumentation.

## Follow-Up Signals
- Telemetry: Monitor documentation usage analytics, onboarding completion rates, feedback volume.
- Review: Knowledge Steward, Client Success Lead, and Legal approve their respective artifacts before launch.
- Next Re-evaluation: Prior to general availability or upon major feature expansion.
