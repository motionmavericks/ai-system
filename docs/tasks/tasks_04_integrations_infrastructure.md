# Motion Mavericks Task Plan â€“ Phase 04 Integrations & Infrastructure
Generated: 2025-09-18T06:09:28+00:00
Context:
- Configure third-party services, observability stack, background processing, and infrastructure guardrails that support the Motion Mavericks MVP.
- Ensure secrets, networking, and deployment resources comply with residency and reliability constraints.

## Tasks
| ID | Description | Required Inputs | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria | Owner |
|----|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| I-001 | Configure Neon database (branches, pooling, backups), apply RLS policies, and document maintenance procedures. | `docs/playbook/06-data-model-and-storage/06-04-backup-and-restore.md`; `automations/build-spec.yaml` | F-005 | Neon environments created; backups scheduled; RLS enforcement validated via tests; maintenance runbook stored. | Human: Reliability Partner |
| I-002 | Set up Vercel projects (dev/staging/prod), preview deployments, edge middleware, and region residency settings. | `docs/playbook/13-devops-ci-cd/13-02-cd-and-release-strategy.md`; `docs/playbook/05-project-setup/05-03-environments-and-secrets.md` | F-002 | Preview deploys per PR; staging/prod locked behind approvals; residency documented; edge middleware active. | Agent: Implementer |
| I-003 | Integrate Mux direct uploads, playback credentials, and webhook signing keys with rotation scripts. | `docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-05-third-party-webhooks.md` | B-004 | Upload credentials stored securely; webhook signature verified; rotation script tested; monitoring alerts on failure. | Agent: Implementer |
| I-004 | Configure Resend domains, templates, and Slack webhook connectors; build notification template repository. | `docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-03-email-and-notifications.md` | B-005 | Resend domain verified; templates versioned; Slack notifier test message delivered; preference center shows available channels. | Agent: Implementer |
| I-005 | Establish caching layer (Upstash Redis) for session/state caching, rate limiting buckets, and share-link throttling. | `docs/playbook/09-backend/09-01-service-boundaries.md`; `docs/playbook/11-security-and-compliance/11-01-security-baseline.md` | B-001 | Cache cluster provisioned; TTL policies configured; cache metrics monitored; failover fallback documented. | Agent: Implementer |
| I-006 | Wire logging/metrics/tracing exporters (Pino, OpenTelemetry, Grafana stack) with correlation IDs and sampling strategies. | `docs/playbook/14-observability/14-01-logging.md`; `docs/playbook/14-observability/14-02-metrics-sli-slo.md` | B-006 | Logs structured with trace IDs; metrics dashboards exist; tracing sampling tuned; alert routing verified. | Agent: Implementer |
| I-007 | Create infrastructure-as-code snippets/terraform notes for neon branches, Vercel settings, and secret stores for future automation. | `docs/playbook/13-devops-ci-cd/13-05-infrastructure-as-code.md` | I-001,I-002 | IaC samples stored; documentation explains manual vs automated steps; future pipeline tasks identified. | Human: Technical Delivery Lead |
| I-008 | Document third-party SLA monitoring (Mux, Resend, Clerk, Upstash) and escalation contacts; integrate with incident tooling. | `docs/playbook/15-performance-and-reliability/15-03-reliability-engineering.md`; `docs/playbook/11-security-and-compliance/11-05-incident-response.md` | I-003,I-004,I-005 | SLA dashboards configured; escalation matrix recorded; incident tooling receives alerts. | Human: Reliability Partner |

## Sequencing & Notes
- Infrastructure tasks run parallel with backend after foundations; ensure monitoring/alerting ready before QA and release phases.
- Open question on event bus (Cron vs Inngest) should be settled before finalising background job configuration.

## Follow-Up Signals
- Telemetry: Monitor Neon metrics, CDN response, webhook success, cache hit rate.
- Review: Reliability Partner signs off on infrastructure readiness; Security lead reviews secrets and rotations.
- Next Re-evaluation: After I-006 completes or before resilience drills.
