# Motion Mavericks Task Plan â€“ Phase 01 Foundation
Generated: 2025-09-18T06:09:28+00:00
Context:
- Establish codebase, tooling, and environmental scaffolding for the Motion Mavericks Portal MVP.
- Ensure repository, secret management, and architectural groundwork align with playbook guardrails prior to domain implementation.

## Tasks
| ID | Description | Required Inputs | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria | Owner |
|----|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| F-001 | Scaffold Turborepo/Next.js 15 monorepo with pnpm, ESLint/Prettier, Vitest, Husky hooks, and shared TS config. | `automations/build-spec.yaml`; `docs/playbook/05-project-setup/05-01-repository-setup.md` | None | `pnpm install` succeeds; lint/typecheck scripts pass locally/CI; Husky enforces formatting + commit lint. | Agent: Implementer |
| F-002 | Configure environment template `.env.example` with Clerk, Neon, Resend, Mux, Upstash, Sentry, feature flags, and rotation notes. | `.env.example`; `docs/playbook/05-project-setup/05-03-environments-and-secrets.md` | F-001 | Secrets documented; Vercel/Neon envs created; rotation runbook captured in repo. | Agent: Implementer |
| F-003 | Model high-level architecture diagram, domain contexts, and service boundaries; validate against ADRs. | `docs/playbook/04-architecture-and-decisions/04-01-system-context.md`; ADRs | F-001 | Architecture diagram stored; service boundary checklist signed off by Reliability Partner. | Human: Technical Delivery Lead |
| F-004 | Define Drizzle schema skeleton with tenants/users/projects/assets/notifications tables and RLS strategy. | `docs/playbook/06-data-model-and-storage/06-01-schema-design.md` | F-002 | Schema compiles; initial migration generated; review comments resolved. | Agent: Implementer |
| F-005 | Implement migration + rollback pipeline, seed script for pilot data, and automated schema drift detection. | `docs/playbook/06-data-model-and-storage/06-02-migrations-plan.md` | F-004 | `pnpm db:migrate`/`rollback` succeed; seed creates pilot tenants; drift check integrated in CI. | Agent: Implementer |
| F-006 | Establish coding standards, commit strategy, and documentation for repo conventions (branch naming, feature toggles, workspace layout). | `docs/playbook/05-project-setup/05-02-coding-standards.md` | F-001 | Standards doc merged; PR template references guidelines; enforcement automated where possible. | Human: Knowledge Steward |

## Sequencing & Notes
- F-001 must precede schema, secrets, and standards work; F-004/F-005 wire the database foundation utilised by later phases.
- Capture architectural decisions as ADRs to unblock API and integration planning.

## Follow-Up Signals
- Telemetry: N/A pre-implementation.
- Review: Technical Delivery Lead approves repo setup; Reliability Partner signs off on schema approach.
- Next Re-evaluation: After completion of F-005 or when backlog planning begins.
