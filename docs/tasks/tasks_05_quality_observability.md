# Motion Mavericks Task Plan – Phase 05 Quality & Observability
Generated: 2025-09-18T06:09:28+00:00
Context:
- Implement automated testing, performance verification, accessibility audits, and observability guardrails to enforce Motion Mavericks MVP quality targets.
- Integrate these checks into CI/CD so regressions are caught before release.

## Tasks
| ID | Description | Required Inputs | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria | Owner |
|----|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| Q-001 | Author Vitest unit suites for domain services, repository helpers, and frontend hooks with ≥80% coverage thresholds. | `docs/playbook/12-testing-and-quality/12-02-unit-tests.md`; `docs/playbook/12-testing-and-quality/12-01-test-strategy.md` | B-002,B-003,FE-004 | Coverage report ≥0.8; CI fails below threshold; flaky tests quarantined with follow-up issues. | Agent: Implementer |
| Q-002 | Build Supertest/Pact integration tests covering auth, project, task, asset, notification APIs with contract validation. | `docs/playbook/12-testing-and-quality/12-03-integration-tests.md`; `docs/playbook/07-apis-and-contracts/07-02-endpoints-and-contracts.md` | Q-001; B-002-B-005 | Contracts published; provider stubs maintained; CI step enforces compatibility; test artifacts archived. | Agent: Implementer |
| Q-003 | Create Playwright end-to-end suites for onboarding, milestone approval, task update, asset upload, share link playback, and preference management. | `docs/playbook/12-testing-and-quality/12-04-e2e-tests.md`; `docs/playbook/03-ux-and-design/03-02-journeys-and-flows.md` | FE-005,FE-006,FE-007 | Tests run headless in CI; videos/screenshots saved; success criteria documented; flake rate <2%. | Agent: Implementer |
| Q-004 | Execute k6 performance tests targeting API latency, asset upload throughput, notification queues, and share link playback metrics. | `docs/playbook/12-testing-and-quality/12-05-performance-tests.md`; `docs/playbook/15-performance-and-reliability/15-01-load-and-stress-testing.md` | Q-002,Q-003 | p95 latency <300ms; upload throughput meets baseline; results stored with remediation plan if thresholds exceeded. | Agent: Implementer |
| Q-005 | Run accessibility audits (axe CI, manual keyboard/screen reader checks) and capture VPAT draft for compliance. | `docs/playbook/12-testing-and-quality/12-06-accessibility-tests.md`; `docs/playbook/08-frontend/08-06-accessibility-a11y.md` | FE-009 | All critical accessibility issues resolved; VPAT sections drafted; audit evidence stored. | Agent: Implementer |
| Q-006 | Configure observability dashboards and alerts (Grafana, Sentry) monitoring SLOs, job queues, webhook failures; verify alert routing. | `docs/playbook/14-observability/14-02-metrics-sli-slo.md`; `automations/build-spec.yaml` | I-006 | Dashboards available to stakeholders; synthetic alert test triggers PagerDuty; runbooks reference dashboards. | Agent: Implementer |
| Q-007 | Integrate all quality checks into GitHub Actions pipeline with gating rules, artifact uploads, and notification hooks. | `docs/playbook/13-devops-ci-cd/13-01-ci-pipeline.md`; `docs/playbook/12-testing-and-quality/12-01-test-strategy.md` | Q-001-Q-006 | Pipeline stages sequential; failure notifications sent; artifacts accessible; branch protections require green pipeline. | Agent: Implementer |

## Sequencing & Notes
- Testing tasks (Q-001 → Q-005) inform pipeline integration (Q-007); performance/accessibility may iterate with frontend team.
- Observability dashboards (Q-006) must align with reliability SLIs to avoid noisy alerts.

## Follow-Up Signals
- Telemetry: Monitor test pass/fail trends, alert fatigue, and coverage drift.
- Review: QA Lead signs off on automation coverage; Reliability Partner validates alert thresholds.
- Next Re-evaluation: Prior to release planning (Phase 06) or upon significant scope change.
