# Motion Mavericks Task Plan â€“ Phase 02 Backend & APIs
Generated: 2025-09-18T06:09:28+00:00
Context:
- Deliver secure, multi-tenant backend services for Motion Mavericks covering projects, milestones, tasks, assets, share links, notifications, and audit logging.
- Align API behaviour with playbook contracts, compliance guardrails, and telemetry expectations.

## Tasks
| ID | Description | Required Inputs | Dependencies | Acceptance Criteria | Owner |
|----|-------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| B-001 | Implement Clerk auth, invitation lifecycle, session refresh, and tenant/role middleware with Neon RLS policies. | `docs/playbook/07-apis-and-contracts/07-03-auth-and-authorisation.md`; `docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-01-identity-provider.md` | F-005 | Admin can invite Agency/Guest; magic link flow succeeds; middleware injects tenant context; integration tests cover role enforcement. | Agent: Implementer |
| B-002 | Build Admin project & milestone APIs (CRUD, approvals, archiving) with validation, audit hooks, and optimistic concurrency. | `docs/playbook/07-apis-and-contracts/07-02-endpoints-and-contracts.md`; `docs/playbook/09-backend/09-02-business-logic.md` | B-001 | Routes return contract-compliant responses; invalid data rejected; audit log entries persistent; Supertest suite passes. | Agent: Implementer |
| B-003 | Deliver Agency task board APIs (task CRUD, assignment, comments, status transitions) including activity feed and event emission. | `docs/playbook/03-ux-and-design/03-02-journeys-and-flows.md`; `docs/playbook/09-backend/09-02-business-logic.md` | B-002 | Task operations succeed with concurrency safeguards; events emitted for telemetry; integration tests cover permutations. | Agent: Implementer |
| B-004 | Implement asset pipeline services: signed uploads, Mux integration, webhook processors, share-link token generation, and retention policies. | `docs/playbook/04-architecture-and-decisions/04-03-data-flows.md`; `docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-05-third-party-webhooks.md` | B-002 | Upload->transcode lifecycle automated; webhook retries handled; share links hashed & expiring; compliance logging captured. | Agent: Implementer |
| B-005 | Build notification subsystem including Resend transactional emails, digest jobs, Slack optionality, and preference management. | `docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-03-email-and-notifications.md`; `docs/playbook/07-apis-and-contracts/07-05-webhooks-and-events.md` | B-003 | Preference API shapes persisted; digests scheduled; transactional emails logged; audit trail accessible. | Agent: Implementer |
| B-006 | Introduce background job orchestration (Vercel Cron/Inngest), queue monitoring, and failure remediation flows. | `docs/playbook/09-backend/09-03-background-jobs.md`; `docs/playbook/14-observability/14-01-logging.md` | B-005 | Jobs triggered per schedule; retries/backoff configured; monitoring dashboards display success/failure; runbooks reference remediation steps. | Agent: Implementer |
| B-007 | Expose public webhooks for partner ingest (future) with verification scaffold and stub handlers to satisfy compliance preview. | `docs/playbook/07-apis-and-contracts/07-05-webhooks-and-events.md`; `docs/playbook/10-integrations/10-05-third-party-webhooks.md` | B-005 | Webhook endpoint validates signatures; stub logic returns 202; documentation outlines onboarding steps; tests cover signature failure. | Agent: Implementer |
| B-008 | Harden API security with rate limiting, abuse detection, and structured error responses referencing guardrails. | `docs/playbook/11-security-and-compliance/11-01-security-baseline.md`; `docs/playbook/11-security-and-compliance/11-04-compliance-checklist.md` | B-001 | Rate limits enforced; suspicious activity logged; security review sign-off; penetration test prep items tracked. | Agent: Implementer |

## Sequencing & Notes
- Auth foundation (B-001) precedes all domain APIs; B-006 ensures durability and observability for asynchronous flows.
- Consultation required for event bus selection (Cron vs Inngest) before finalising B-006.

## Follow-Up Signals
- Telemetry: API latency, task update volume, webhook success rate, notification queue depth.
- Review: Technical Delivery Lead + Reliability Partner sign off before frontend consumes endpoints.
- Next Re-evaluation: Upon completion of B-006 or discovery of new integration requirements.
