## Context
With limited internal capacity, Motion Mavericks relies on automation and clear metrics to signal when contracted partners must engage. The KPIs below derive from the integrated brief and ensure Owen can demonstrate compliance, resilience, and fiscal discipline to client organisations.

    <section id="metrics" heading="Metrics and acceptance">
      <instructions>Explain how metrics gate release.</instructions>
      <content><![CDATA[
## Metrics and acceptance
- MVP launch requires three consecutive weekly reports meeting all targets, except where negotiated risk acceptance is documented by Owen.
- Any breach of signed playback, residency, or cost variance triggers immediate escalation to the relevant agency and pauses release activities until remediated.
- Error budget and webhook recovery performance feed directly into incident rehearsal acceptance criteria before onboarding client crews.

    <section id="dependencies" heading="Dependencies">
      <instructions>List dependencies impacting metrics.</instructions>
      <content><![CDATA[
## Dependencies
- Security advisor must provide access to Mux token validation reports on the agreed cadence.
- Reliability agency requires AWS telemetry integration to expose DLQ metrics; Owen coordinates provisioning.
- Compliance consultant depends on Neon residency tagging and Vercel edge location metadata exports.

## Open questions
- Which agency will own ongoing DLQ telemetry once the MVP transitions to steady state?
- Will client crews require direct visibility into the cost variance dashboard, or is a monthly summary sufficient?
