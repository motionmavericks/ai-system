## Details

### Positioning pillars
1. Unified production management hub for agencies and clients.
2. Secure, traceable share links replacing scattered cloud folders.
3. Real-time milestone tracking reducing status meetings.
4. Australian data residency and recovery guarantees (RPO/RTO).
5. Accessible, collaborative experience for all stakeholders.

### Target audiences
- Primary: Agency producers, project managers, operations leads.
- Secondary: Client marketing heads, creative directors, procurement.
- Internal: Motion Mavericks production teams, leadership.

### Messaging matrix
| Audience | Core message | Proof point |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Agency producer | “Deliver campaigns faster with shared portals and audit trails.” | Case study: MKTG saved 6 hours/week; share link audit logs |
| Client stakeholder | “View assets securely, track approvals without email clutter.” | Guest links with expiry and comment history |
| Motion Mavericks leadership | “Scale agency partnerships without sacrificing control.” | Centralised dashboard, compliance checklist |

### Channels & tactics
- **Agency briefings**: Invite-only sessions (Sydney, Melbourne) with live demo.
- **Email campaigns**: Three-part nurture (teaser, feature deep dive, onboarding steps).
- **LinkedIn posts**: Founder thought leadership, customer testimonials.
- **Website landing page**: `motionmavericks.au/portal` with demo video and CTA.
- **Video walkthroughs**: 3-minute product tour, 1-minute share link explainer.
- **Client success webinars**: Monthly training for agency teams.
- **PR outreach**: Press release to industry publications (Campaign Brief, AdNews).
- **Internal enablement**: Sales collateral, FAQ, objection handling doc.

### Asset checklist
- Deck: portal overview w/ pricing options (17-01).
- One-pager: features/benefits, compliance highlights.
- FAQ: share link security, residency, integrations.
- Video scripts for product tour and testimonial.
- Social graphics emphasising milestones, RPO/RTO.
- Knowledge base articles (16-05) linked in communications.

### Timeline (indicative)
| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| -6 | Finalise messaging, design assets, record demo video |
| -4 | Soft launch to pilot agencies; capture testimonials |
| -3 | Press release draft, legal review, landing page QA |
| -2 | Agency briefings, enablement sessions for internal teams |
| -1 | Email teaser, social countdown, finalize support readiness |
| Launch week | Press release, landing page live, webinar, follow-up emails |
| +1 | Collect feedback, publish case study draft, start nurture campaigns |
| +4 | Review KPIs, adjust messaging, release second wave assets |

### KPIs
- 80% of pilot agencies fully onboarded within 60 days.
- ≥50% open rate on launch email; ≥20% click-through to landing page.
- 500 unique landing page visits in first month.
- 3 published testimonials by Q1 2026.

### Governance
- Marketing lead owns campaign execution; weekly stand-ups with GTM, legal, product.
- Content approvals: Marketing → Legal → Founder.
- Change log entry after major updates.

### Risks & mitigations
- Overpromising future features → emphasise roadmap, provide timeline disclaimers.
- Support overload → align with 16-03 playbooks and scale Tier 1 coverage.
- Compliance misalignment → legal review of all materials.
