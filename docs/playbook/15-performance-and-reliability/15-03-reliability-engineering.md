## Summary
This reliability engineering guide establishes practices ensuring Motion Mavericks meets availability, latency, and recovery targets. It details SRE roles, operational processes, error budget management, and continuous improvement actions across Admin, Agency, and Guest experiences.

      <content><![CDATA[
## Context
The portal orchestrates mission-critical workflows. Reliability must cover collaborative milestones, asset streaming, notifications, and share links while integrating with security, privacy, and compliance requirements. SRE work balances feature delivery with stability.

      <content><![CDATA[
## Scope
- SRE responsibilities, runbooks, error budget policies, and operational rituals.
- Interfaces with development teams, QA, security, and client success.
- Excludes general project management responsibilities covered elsewhere.

## Details

### Roles and responsibilities
| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| Reliability Partner (SRE lead) | Own SLOs, run reliability reviews, manage on-call rotation |
| Technical Lead | Align architecture decisions with reliability goals, approve budget spend |
| QA Engineer | Integrate reliability checks into test suites |
| Client Success Lead | Feed customer feedback into reliability backlog |
| Security Specialist | Ensure reliability solutions respect security/privacy controls |

### Operational rhythms
- **Daily**: Check dashboards for anomalies, review overnight alerts.
- **Weekly**: Reliability sync reviewing error budgets, incidents, upcoming changes.
- **Monthly**: Capacity review, performance trend analysis, backlog grooming.
- **Quarterly**: Reliability roadmap update, chaos drill, compliance review.

### Error budget policy
- Track error budgets per SLO (14-02).
- If budget consumption exceeds 50% mid-cycle, limit feature releases to critical fixes.
- At 100% consumption, freeze new launches until corrective actions complete.

### Change management
- Require risk assessment for high-impact changes (share link logic, asset pipeline, notification engine).
- Use progressive delivery (feature flags, canaries) with rollback plans.
- Document major changes in change log and reliability notes.

### Incident lifecycle integration
- Follow incident response (11-05); reliability lead ensures root causes addressed.
- Post-incident: update reliability backlog, link to runbook enhancements.
- Track mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR) metrics.

### Reliability backlog categories
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Guardrails | Circuit breakers for share link API, rate limiter improvements |
| Observability | Additional traces for asset pipeline, share link analytics |
| Automation | Auto-remediation scripts for stuck notifications |
| Testing | Extended load tests, chaos scenarios |
| Documentation | Runbook updates, training materials |

### Tooling
- SLO tracking via Grafana, error budget calculations automated in spreadsheet.
- Linear project `Reliability` stores tasks with priority determined by impact & effort.
- On-call rotation managed via PagerDuty, schedule stored in 19-01 support rotation doc.

### Continuous improvement
- Conduct reliability retrospectives post major releases.
- Benchmark metrics quarter-over-quarter; set improvement targets (e.g., reduce MTTR by 20%).
- Collaborate with agencies to capture real-world issues and integrate into backlog.

### Skills and training
- Provide onboarding module for engineers covering SRE principles, incident response, observability tools.
- Annual training budget for reliability certifications or workshops.
