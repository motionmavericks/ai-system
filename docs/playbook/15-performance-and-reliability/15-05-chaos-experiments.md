## Summary
Chaos experiments validate Motion Mavericks’ resilience by intentionally injecting failures into critical workflows. Scenarios target share link expiries, webhook drops, cache outages, and dependency downtime to ensure controls maintain service quality and recovery commitments.

      <instructions>Outline the current situation, problem, drivers, and constraints.</instructions>
      <content><![CDATA[
## Context
As the portal scales, hidden dependencies could jeopardise milestone tracking, asset delivery, or notifications. Chaos testing exposes weaknesses before clients experience them. Experiments must be controlled, reversible, and compliant with privacy and residency requirements.

    <section id="scope" heading="Scope">
      <instructions>State in-scope items, out-of-scope exclusions, and key assumptions.</instructions>
      <content><![CDATA[
## Scope
- Planned chaos experiments in staging (primary) and limited production validation with safeguards.
- Targets include share link token service, Mux webhooks, Upstash Redis, Resend notifications, and Neon failover.
- Excludes destructive tests on production data stores without backup verification.

## Details

### Experiment catalogue
| ID | Hypothesis | Method | Expected outcome | Safeguards |
|----|------------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| CE-01 | Share token cache outage handled gracefully | Disable Upstash instance for 5 min | Requests fall back to database validation; latency <500 ms | Run in staging, monitoring, auto-restore script |
| CE-02 | Share link expiry enforcement under replay | Replay expired tokens via synthetic guests | System rejects requests, logs audit event, no token reuse | Limit to synthetic accounts, alert on unexpected success |
| CE-03 | Mux webhook delay | Delay webhook delivery 10 min | Asset status remains pending, notifications withheld until confirm | Manual resend to complete flow |
| CE-04 | Resend outage fallback | Block Resend API; switch to backup provider | Notification queue retries, uses fallback provider | Test only on staging; ensure messages flagged as test |
| CE-05 | Neon primary failover | Promote replica manually | App reconnects within RTO, data intact | Conduct after backup, ensure no production write conflicts |
| CE-06 | Notification digest burst | Trigger 10x normal volume | Queue scales, no drops, SLO maintained | Monitor bounce, limit scope |

### Execution process
1. Document experiment plan with owner, date, and rollback steps.
2. Obtain approvals from Reliability Partner, Security Specialist, and impacted stakeholders.
3. Notify teams via `#reliability` channel before start; schedule off-peak.
4. Run experiment; capture metrics, logs, traces.
5. Conduct retrospective summarising outcome, gaps, and action items.
6. Update reliability backlog and runbooks (16-02) with findings.

### Guardrails
- Production experiments require executive approval and must have kill switch to revert within 5 minutes.
- Never run chaos tests during active client deliveries without confirmation.
- Record experiment results in change log and compliance documentation if impacts operations.

### Tooling
- Gremlin or open-source Chaos Mesh (if using Kubernetes for auxiliary services); for serverless, use scripted toggles via APIs.
- Use feature flags to simulate failure modes (e.g., forcing share token errors).
- Observability dashboards (14-05) provide live metrics; set temporary alerts for anomalies.

### Metrics to monitor
- Latency, error rate, share link success, notification queue size.
- Audit log entries validating security responses.
- Recovery timing vs RTO targets.

### Reporting
- Store experiment records in `<REDACTED>` drive with metadata (ID, date, owner, outcome).
- Summaries shared in monthly reliability sync.
- Incorporate key learnings into quarterly executive update.

## Open questions
- Should we invest in dedicated chaos tooling or continue with scripted experiments?
- Do we extend chaos coverage to client-facing production flows after initial hardening?
