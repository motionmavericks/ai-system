## 1. Objective and success definition

- **Problem this brief solves**: The original Motion Mavericks MVP specification lacks critical security, compliance, and operational resilience measures required for production deployment. Four independent AI agent reviews have identified significant P0 risks including data privacy vulnerabilities, inadequate access controls, missing compliance frameworks, and insufficient system reliability mechanisms.

- **Desired outcomes once documentation is generated**: A production-ready MVP that meets enterprise security standards, complies with GDPR and Australian privacy regulations, implements robust access controls with signed video playback, includes comprehensive cost monitoring and rate limiting, and provides operational resilience through proper incident response procedures.

- **Success metrics for the Agentis coding agent**:
  - All P0 security vulnerabilities addressed (100% implementation of critical recommendations)
  - GDPR compliance framework implemented with data retention and deletion capabilities
  - Cost monitoring and rate limiting preventing budget overruns
  - System reliability improved through webhook resilience and proper error handling
  - Operational readiness with defined SLOs and incident response procedures

### Cost Monitoring and Budget Controls – `docs/playbook/operations/cost-monitoring.md`
<docBlueprint path="docs/playbook/operations/cost-monitoring.md" template="01-universal-template.md" owner="DevOps Team">

#### 1. Summary
- Purpose: Implement comprehensive cost monitoring with automated alerts and budget controls across all services
- Audience: DevOps team, finance team, management
- Outcome once delivered: Proactive cost management preventing budget overruns with automated scaling controls

#### 2. Context
- Problem statement: Uncontrolled video processing and storage costs could escalate rapidly without monitoring
- Background details: Agent reviews identified lack of cost controls as P0 financial risk
- Constraints: Must integrate with Mux, Neon, Vercel, Resend billing APIs
- Related work or precedents: Cloud cost management best practices, usage-based billing alerts
- Key supporting links: Service provider billing APIs, cost management frameworks

#### 3. Goals
- G1: Real-time cost monitoring across all service providers
- G2: Automated alerts at 50%, 80%, 100% of budget thresholds
- G3: Hard limits and throttling at 90% budget consumption

#### 4. Non-goals
- Complex cost allocation across multiple projects
- Predictive cost modeling beyond current usage trends
- Integration with enterprise accounting systems

#### 5. Scope
##### In scope
- Service cost monitoring (Mux, Neon, Vercel, Resend)
- Budget threshold alerts and escalation
- Automated service throttling and limits
- Cost dashboard and reporting

##### Out of scope
- Staff cost tracking
- Infrastructure cost optimization recommendations
- Multi-currency cost reporting

##### Boundaries and assumptions
- Assumption: Service APIs provide accurate usage data → Validation plan: Compare with billing statements
- Assumption: 24-hour cost reporting latency acceptable → Validation plan: Stakeholder confirmation

#### 6. Stakeholders and roles
| Name | Role | Responsibilities | Authority | Contact |
|------|------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| Finance Manager | Budget Owner | Budget approval and oversight | Spending authority | finance@company.com |
| DevOps Engineer | Implementation | Technical monitoring setup | Operational decisions | devops@company.com |
| Product Manager | Feature Owner | Usage impact assessment | Feature limitation authority | product@company.com |

#### 7. Requirements
##### 7.1 Functional
| ID | Requirement | Priority | Acceptance notes |
|----|-------------|----------|------------------|
| FR-1 | Real-time cost monitoring dashboard | P0 | Updated within 24 hours of usage |
| FR-2 | Automated budget threshold alerts | P0 | Notifications at 50%, 80%, 100% |
| FR-3 | Service throttling at 90% budget | P0 | Automated rate limiting activation |
| FR-4 | Monthly cost reporting | P0 | Detailed breakdown by service |

##### 7.2 Non-functional
| Category | Target | Evidence method | Owner |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Performance | Dashboard load <2 seconds | Performance testing | DevOps |
| Reliability | 99.9% monitoring uptime | System monitoring | DevOps |
| Accuracy | <5% variance from actual bills | Billing reconciliation | Finance |

#### 8. Approach
- Preferred approach: Automated monitoring with progressive alerts and throttling
- Alternatives considered: Manual monitoring (rejected for scale), third-party tools (rejected for cost)
- Trade-offs: Development effort vs automated cost control and financial protection

#### 9. Structure or design
- Overview: Centralized cost monitoring with service-specific adapters and alert mechanisms
- Components: Cost aggregation service, alert system, throttling controls, reporting dashboard
- Diagram links: Cost monitoring architecture diagram

#### 10. Data
- Entities: Usage metrics, cost calculations, budget thresholds, alert history
- Sources and owners: Service provider APIs, internal usage tracking
- Retention rules: Cost data retained for 2 years for trend analysis
- Data quality checks: Usage validation, billing reconciliation
