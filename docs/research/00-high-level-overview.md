# Motion Mavericks MVP Portal – Execution Plan (Rev B Spec)

## Preflight Stage

### Confirm Requirements & Goals (Est. 2–4h)
- Description: Review the Motion Mavericks MVP Spec (Rev B) with stakeholders to confirm the feature set and priorities. Break down the spec into high-level features (e.g., user auth, video upload, sharing, notifications) and clarify any ambiguities. Define the MVP scope to ensure alignment on deliverables.
- Dependencies: Finalized Spec Rev B; stakeholder availability.
- Acceptance Criteria: All team members have a shared understanding of MVP features and goals. Open questions in the spec are resolved and documented.

### Tech Stack Decisions & Environment Setup (Est. 0.5–1d)
- Description: Decide on the core tech stack per spec. For this project, we will use Next.js (App Router) for the full-stack web app, TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, and shadcn/ui for ready-made accessible components [1]. Authentication will be handled by Clerk (hosted auth) for speed and security, with the option of NextAuth (Auth.js) considered if needed [2]. We will use Neon (serverless Postgres DB) with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database access [3], Vercel Blob for file storage (images, etc.) [4], and Mux for video streaming (for optimized encoding & multi-resolution playback) [9]. Emails/notifications will use Resend service [7], and testing will leverage Playwright for end-to-end browser tests. Also set up version control (e.g., GitHub) and project management tools (if any).
- Dependencies: Confirmation of all required third-party services (accounts/keys for Neon, Clerk, Mux, Resend, etc.).
- Acceptance Criteria: Tech stack is finalized and documented. All necessary service accounts are created and API keys are available securely. The development environment is ready (Node.js v18+, IDE, etc.), and a new Next.js app is initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind (create-next-app with --app --tailwind flags).

### Provision Infrastructure & Credentials (Est. 3–5h)
- Description: Create and configure project resources on required platforms:
  - Set up a Neon Postgres project: create a database (use default neondb name) and note the connection string. Configure a database user if needed and ensure network access for Vercel.
  - Set up Clerk (or Auth.js) for authentication: create a Clerk application in the Clerk dashboard and enable identity providers as per spec (email/password, social logins, etc.). Obtain Clerk API keys (publishable and secret).
  - Set up Mux: create a Mux account, get API access tokens (MUX token ID & secret) for video uploads. Configure a Mux webhook endpoint URL (even if placeholder) for video upload status events.
  - Set up Resend [7]: create account, get API key and verify sender domain (DNS verification for emails).
  - Provision a Vercel Blob storage [4]: in Vercel project settings, add a Blob database (if required via Vercel console) for storing files.
  - Initialize Sentry project [8] for the portal (one for front+backend using Sentry’s Next.js SDK [8]) and obtain DSN.
  - Prepare any other needed API keys (e.g., if using third-party for SMS or others, not in spec). Store all credentials in a secure .env.local for development.
- Dependencies: Completion of service sign-ups.
- Acceptance Criteria: All external services are provisioned. A local .env file contains keys like DATABASE_URL, CLERK_SECRET_KEY, MUX_TOKEN_ID, MUX_TOKEN_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY, SENTRY_DSN, etc. Test connections where possible (e.g., test DB connection string validity, basic Clerk init).

### Initialize Codebase and Repository (Est. 2–3h)
- Description: Generate a new Next.js project (if not done already) using the App Router architecture. Include Tailwind CSS and ESLint configurations by default. Initialize a Git repository and push to remote (GitHub/GitLab) with appropriate naming (e.g., motion-mavericks-mvp). Set up the project structure: use the /app directory for Next.js App Router. Commit a baseline.
- Dependencies: Tech stack confirmation; Node environment.
- Acceptance Criteria: The base Next.js application runs locally (npm run dev) showing the starter page. Repository is set up with initial commit. Team members can pull and run the project.

### Team Roles & Workflow Setup (Est. 2h)
- Description: (If a team is involved) Define roles and responsibilities (frontend, backend, QA, devops). Establish coding standards (Prettier, ESLint rules), branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, PR reviews), and a basic Kanban board for task tracking. Set up CI integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests and lint on pushes. This ensures a smooth collaboration workflow.
- Dependencies: Repository setup; agreement on processes.
- Acceptance Criteria: Team members agree on the workflow. Linting and formatting tools are in place (e.g., ESLint, Prettier configs) and CI pipeline is ready to be configured in later stages when tests are written.

## Product Discovery Stage

### User Story Mapping & Use Cases (Est. 4–6h)
- Description: Derive user stories and primary use cases from the Rev B spec. For Motion Mavericks, key personas might be content creators (who upload and share videos) and viewers (who access shared videos). Map out the user journey: e.g., Sign up/log in, create a profile, upload a motion video, get notified when processing is done, share the video with others, and view shared videos. Identify all required pages and interactions (upload form, video player page, share link flow, notification prompts, etc.). Prioritize core MVP stories – e.g., “As a user, I can upload a video and share it so that others can view it.”
- Dependencies: Final spec details on features.
- Acceptance Criteria: A list of user stories or job stories is documented. The team can clearly articulate each feature from an end-user perspective. Non-goals or post-MVP features (if any) are noted.

### Define Functional Requirements & Acceptance Criteria (Est. 4h)
- Description: For each major feature, define what it must do in detail and how we’ll know it’s working. For example:
  - Authentication: Users must be able to sign up, log in, and log out. Acceptance: given valid credentials, user can authenticate via Clerk; protected pages redirect to login if not authed.
  - Video Upload: Users can upload a video file (with specified size/format limits). The system shows an upload progress and then indicates processing. Acceptance: after upload, video is sent to Mux and a placeholder appears; once Mux finishes encoding, video is playable.
  - Share Link: Users can generate a shareable link or send an email invite for a video. Acceptance: a unique link is produced that allows a recipient to view the video (maybe without login if spec allows), and if emailed, the recipient receives an email via Resend.
  - Notifications: The system sends an email when certain events happen (e.g., video ready, or an invite sent). Acceptance: emails are delivered to the right user (can verify via Resend’s dashboard or a test inbox).
  - UI/UX: The portal should be responsive and accessible. Acceptance: basic accessibility audit (ARIA labels, etc.) passes; layout works on mobile and desktop.
- Dependencies: User stories; possibly UX input if available.
- Acceptance Criteria: Each feature has clear acceptance criteria documented. These will guide development and testing, ensuring we know when the feature is “done.”

### UX Wireframes & Design Mockups (Est. 1–2d)
- Description: Create simple wireframes or sketches for key screens: login/signup, dashboard or video list, upload form, video detail/player page, share dialog, and any settings or profile page. Define the layout and flow between screens (e.g., after upload, user is taken to a processing status page or the video detail page). If a design system or style guide exists (colors, logo of Motion Mavericks), apply it in a basic style. Since we plan to use shadcn/ui and Tailwind, ensure the design can be achieved with those components. This step will also help identify which shadcn/ui components to use (modals, toasts, navigation menu, etc.).
- Dependencies: User story mapping, possibly designer input if any.
- Acceptance Criteria: Low-fidelity wireframes for each major screen/flow are available and reviewed with the team or stakeholders. The design is consistent with spec branding guidelines (if any) and is feasible with our tech stack.

### Backlog & Milestone Planning (Est. 3h)
- Description: Translate the user stories and requirements into a structured backlog. Group tasks into milestones or sprints aligned with our stages (Architecture, Backend, Frontend, etc.). Ensure each backlog item has enough detail for implementation. Identify any external dependencies or research needed (e.g., confirm video format support by Mux, email template design for Resend, etc.). Schedule work roughly (especially if using sprints).
- Dependencies: Completed breakdown of features and acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance Criteria: A backlog is created (in project management tool or document) listing all implementation tasks with priorities. We have a plan for the sequence of development, which mirrors the execution plan stages. Team/stakeholders sign off on this plan before heavy development starts.

## Architecture Stage

### System Architecture & Component Design (Est. 1d)
- Description: Design the high-level architecture of the MVP portal. Motion Mavericks will be a single Next.js application deployed on Vercel (serverless). Determine how the pieces fit together:
  - Use Next.js App Router for a unified frontend and backend (server components for backend logic, API Route Handlers for any REST endpoints needed). This provides full-stack capabilities within one project.
  - Client-Server Data Flow: Leverage React Server Components and, where needed, API routes or Server Actions for form submissions (e.g., file uploads via Vercel Blob or Mux direct uploads).
  - Authentication: Integrate Clerk’s middleware and Provider at the app root to protect routes. Use Clerk’s session to identify the user on the server side (Clerk provides helpers like currentUser in server components). Alternatively, note how this would differ if using NextAuth – but for MVP, we proceed with Clerk for simplicity (enterprise-grade auth out-of-the- box).
  - Database layer: Plan the data models – e.g., User (if storing any user info beyond Clerk ID), Video (with fields: id, ownerId, title, Mux playback ID, status, createdAt), maybe ShareToken (unique token or invite for sharing). Decide relationships (one user to many videos, etc.). Use Drizzle ORM to define schema and run migrations.
  - APIs and services: Decide which operations need dedicated API routes. Likely candidates: video upload (to get upload URL from Mux), Mux webhook handler (to receive video status updates), share link generation, and possibly a protected API to fetch videos list (though can also be done via server component fetching directly from DB).
  - Real-time or Polling: Since Mux processing is asynchronous, decide how the client knows when a video is ready. Plan to utilize Mux webhooks [9] and possibly client polling or a page refresh mechanism. We might store a video’s status in DB (e.g., “processing” vs “ready”) and update on webhook.
  - External integrations: Plan how to integrate Resend for email. Likely, we’ll call Resend’s API from server-side when an event occurs (e.g., user invites someone or after video ready). We might create a reusable function for sending emails (with templates using a library like React Email).
  - Error handling & Logging: Incorporate Sentry in both client and server. Decide to use Sentry’s Next.js SDK initialization (which sets up error boundary and reporting automatically). Also, determine logging strategy for debugging (console logs are fine, and Sentry can capture them as well if configured).
- Dependencies: Product requirements clarity; tech stack availability.
- Acceptance Criteria: A diagram or document describing the architecture is created. It covers how the app, database, auth, storage, and external APIs interact. The team reviews and agrees on this architecture. Future tasks (database design, API design) should directly follow this blueprint.

### Database Schema Design (Est. 4–6h)
- Description: Design the relational schema in Neon/Postgres to support MVP data. Using Drizzle ORM:
  - Define tables and columns according to the data model: likely users (or we may rely on Clerk for user data; if so, perhaps a minimal UserProfile table for additional info), videos (fields: id (UUID or ULID), user_id (from Clerk), title, description, mux_asset_id, mux_playback_id, status, created_at, etc.), shares or video_shares (if implementing share links: fields like token, video_id, created_at, expires_at, maybe email if an invite was sent).
  - Use Drizzle’s schema definitions to create these. Set up primary keys, foreign keys (user_id referencing user or just stored as text if not enforcing due to external user management), and any necessary indexes (e.g., index on video_id in shares).
  - Determine any constraints, e.g., cascade delete videos if user is deleted (though with Clerk likely we won’t delete users in MVP).
  - Plan how migrations will be run. Drizzle has a CLI (drizzle-kit) for generating and running SQL migrations. Decide on migration workflow: possibly generate an initial migration for the base schema and apply it to Neon. Consider using Neon branching for dev/test environment (Neon allows branching the DB for isolated testing).
- Dependencies: Architecture data model decisions.
- Acceptance Criteria: The database schema is documented (ER diagram or description of tables). Drizzle schema code is written (even if not executed yet). The schema covers all necessary data for MVP. Review with team to ensure nothing is missing for data needs.

### Security & Compliance Design (Est. 3h)
- Description: Design how security concerns will be addressed in the system architecture:
  - Authentication & Authorization: With Clerk, most of this is handled for us (Clerk will store PII and manage compliance). Ensure we implement Clerk’s auth middleware to protect API routes and pages by default. Define roles if needed (perhaps not for MVP).
  - Data Protection: Identify any sensitive data in our DB – likely minimal since user credentials are in Clerk. Ensure we do not store sensitive info unencrypted (the videos themselves are in Mux/Blob, links are tokens). Consider using HTTPS for all external calls (Clerk, Neon, etc., should be TLS by default).
  - File Security: Videos on Mux will have public playback IDs (if publicly shareable). If spec requires only invited viewers can see, we might need signed URLs or Mux’s private streaming (playback_policy “signed”). For MVP, assume public playback for simplicity. Vercel Blob files (like images) can be set to public or private as needed when uploading (we’ll likely make uploads public and name them uniquely).
  - API Keys Management: Plan to keep all secrets in Vercel environment variables for production. Limit exposure by not exposing secrets to client (Clerk provides a publishable key for front-end, Mux keys and Resend keys only used server-side, etc.).
  - Compliance: If needed, ensure any user data usage aligns with privacy (Clerk helps with SOC2/ GDPR compliance for auth, as noted in their docs). Not a major focus for MVP beyond using compliant vendors.
- Dependencies: Tech choices; possibly input from security advisor if available.
- Acceptance Criteria: Security measures are documented (likely in an ADR or part of architecture doc). The design addresses authentication, authorization checks on every protected action, and safe handling of user data. The team is aware of these measures and will implement accordingly.

### API Design & External Integrations Plan (Est. 4h)
- Description: Specify each API endpoint or integration in detail:
  - Mux Integration: Decide to implement direct uploads from client to Mux using Mux’s direct upload URLs and uploader component. Design an API route POST /api/videos/upload-url (server action or route handler) that creates a new upload URL via Mux SDK (server) and returns it along with perhaps a new video DB entry in “processing” state. Also design POST /api/webhooks/mux to handle Mux webhooks: on video.asset.ready event, update the corresponding video record with status = ready and Mux playback ID, and possibly trigger a notification email to the uploader (if required).
  - File Upload (Non-video): If users have profile pictures or thumbnails to upload, plan to use Vercel Blob. Possibly an API PUT /api/profile to handle profile avatar upload (as shown in Vercel Blob example storing an avatar) or using a Next.js Route Handler directly with @vercel/blob SDK to store files. Determine file path schema (e.g., avatars/user-<id>.png). Blob returns a public URL which we store in the user profile for display.
  - Share Link API: If sharing via link, design how the link is generated. Perhaps an API route POST /api/videos/{id}/share which creates a share record (with random token or UUID). The returned link could be /share/{token}. Also, a route GET /api/videos/shared?token=XYZ to retrieve video info for a share token (used by the share landing page). If sharing via email, this POST /share can also trigger a Resend email to the specified address with the link.
  - Resend Email: Plan email templates for notifications: e.g., a “video ready” email to user, and a “video shared with you” email to a friend. Outline using Resend’s SDK to send emails by rendering a React email component. We can integrate this in our backend functions – for instance, call resend.emails.send(...) inside the Mux webhook handler (for video ready notification) or inside share link creation (for sending the invite).
  - Scheduled Tasks: Identify any scheduled jobs. One idea: a daily cron to clean up expired share tokens or stale “processing” videos that never got a webhook (error handling). If needed by spec, outline a cron job (using Vercel Cron [10]) to run api/cron/cleanup every night. Another potential cron: send summary emails or usage reports (optional). Define the timing and tasks for each cron job and how to implement them (in vercel.json, map schedule to an API route).
  - KV Cache Usage: Plan where using Vercel KV (Upstash Redis) can improve performance or simplicity. One usage: caching read-heavy data like a public video list or counts. Another: store short-lived share tokens or rate-limit counters in KV for quick checks. For example, when generating a share token, we can also store a key in KV like share:<token> with value videoId and an expiration (so that the share link expires automatically in KV). KV gives low-latency global access to such ephemeral data. Document which data might go to KV vs Postgres.
- Dependencies: Architecture and data model finalization; input from team on any other APIs needed.
- Acceptance Criteria: All endpoints and integration points are designed and documented (e.g., in an API spec or in code comments for route handlers). We know each route’s purpose, request/ response, and security (which need auth). The integration approach for Mux, Resend, Blob, etc. is clearly laid out, minimizing surprises during implementation.

### Frontend Component Architecture (Est. 4h)
- Description: Design the structure of the frontend React components and pages:
  - Decide on page hierarchy using Next.js App Router: e.g., app/page.tsx for the landing or dashboard (if landing page differs when logged in/out), app/upload/page.tsx for upload form, app/videos/[id]/page.tsx for video detail playback, app/share/[token]/ page.tsx for share landing (if share is accessible without login), etc. Also include app/ profile/page.tsx if a user profile page is needed for editing profile.
  - Plan global layouts in Next.js: e.g., app/layout.tsx to include the Clerk <ClerkProvider> and possibly a <Navbar> component if the app has a navigation bar. The ClerkProvider should wrap the app to provide auth context. Also utilize Clerk’s <SignedIn> / <SignedOut> components or hooks to conditionally render content.
  - Identify which shadcn/ui components will be used and if any custom components are needed. Likely candidates: use shadcn’s pre-built components for things like modals (for share dialog), dropdowns (for user menu), buttons, forms, and toast notifications. Ensure we know how to integrate them (shadcn/ui components are copied into our codebase and use Tailwind).
  - State management: Determine if we need a global state or can rely on server-side rendering and React state. Possibly avoid heavy client state by using server-rendered data (e.g., list of videos fetched in server component). For client-only interactions (like showing a toast or tracking form input before submit), use local React state or context as needed. No external state library should be necessary at this stage.
  - Routing & Navigation: If certain pages require auth, ensure to use Clerk’s middleware to protect them (or in App Router, use route segment configuration to protect). Determine fallback UI for loading states (Next.js can have loading.tsx files).
  - Styling approach: We use Tailwind for utility-first styling. Decide on any common style patterns (like container widths, spacings). Possibly set up a Tailwind config theme if needed (colors, etc.).
- Dependencies: UX wireframes; shadcn/ui library availability.
- Acceptance Criteria: A document or diagram for the component/page structure is ready. It lists each page and key components, and how they relate (e.g., UploadForm component used in upload page, VideoCard component used in list, etc.). This guides frontend developers during implementation so they have a clear blueprint of the UI structure.

## Backend Stage

### Set Up Neon Database & Drizzle ORM (Est. 4h)
- Description: Initialize the database and ORM in our codebase:
  - Add the Neon connection string to .env.local (e.g., DATABASE_URL as provided by Neon). Ensure this connection string is not committed. Test connecting to Neon from a local script or via the app.
  - Install Drizzle ORM and the Neon serverless driver if not already installed. Configure Drizzle in Next.js: create a db directory (e.g., src/db/) with a schema.ts and drizzle.ts. In drizzle.ts, initialize the connection using drizzle(neonServerlessClient) with the connection URL.
  - Write the schema definitions in Drizzle for tables identified in architecture. For each table, use Drizzle’s schema builder to define columns and types. For example, define videos table with pgTable('videos', {...}) including user_id, etc. Mark primary keys, and any default timestamps.
  - Use drizzle-kit to generate a SQL migration from the schema (e.g., npx drizzle-kit generate:pg if Drizzle CLI is set up). Verify the generated SQL and run it against the Neon database to create tables (or use drizzle-kit push to apply directly if configured).
  - If Neon allows branching, consider creating a development branch of the DB for local usage and a production branch for deployment. The Neon Vercel integration could automate DB URL injection for preview/staging branches; plan to leverage that if feasible (set up Neon integration in Vercel).
  - Test by inserting a dummy record via Drizzle in a script or temporary API route to ensure everything works. Also handle environment differences (for local dev, Neon connection works; for tests, maybe use a local sqlite or a Neon branch).
- Dependencies: Database schema design completed; Neon project ready.
- Acceptance Criteria: The Neon database has all required tables (verify via Neon console or \dt if using psql). The Next.js app can successfully connect to the DB and perform a basic query without errors. Drizzle is configured and no runtime errors occur for DB operations.

### Implement Authentication & User Management Backend (Est. 4h)
- Description: Integrate the authentication solution on the backend:
  - Clerk Integration: Install Clerk’s Next.js SDK (@clerk/nextjs) and follow their setup steps: add the <ClerkProvider> in layout.tsx, wrap our app. Set up the Clerk middleware (in middleware.ts) as per Clerk docs to protect routes, typically matching all routes except static files. Add Clerk environment keys to .env.local (NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY).
  - Ensure that any Next.js API route that requires auth can get the user’s identity. With Clerk, we can use the withAuth handler or use the currentUser() helper inside server actions/ routes. Test a protected API route by calling it without auth (should be denied) and with a valid session (should succeed).
  - If Auth.js (NextAuth) was chosen instead: set up [...auth]/route.ts with providers (e.g., email/password or OAuth providers). But since we lean toward Clerk as per spec, document NextAuth as an alternative but proceed with Clerk implementation for MVP due to faster setup.
  - User Data in DB: Decide if we need to mirror any user profile info in our DB. For MVP, Clerk holds user profiles, but if we need to store additional fields (e.g., username, bio, preferences), we might have a profiles table keyed by Clerk user_id. If so, implement a Clerk webhook (or use Clerk API on first login) to insert a new profile row when a new user signs up. This could be done by creating an endpoint /api/clerk-webhook to listen for user creation events. Optional: skip this if profile info is not needed server-side.
  - Access Control: On the backend, use the user’s ID from Clerk to scope data queries. For example, when a user requests their video list, use the Clerk user_id to query the videos table for that owner. Enforce that in any API route (to prevent one user accessing another’s data). If a share token is used without auth, design how to restrict data (likely share tokens map directly to a specific video, so that bypasses login but only gives access to that video).
- Dependencies: Neon/Drizzle set up; Clerk or NextAuth account config done; environment variables in place.
- Acceptance Criteria: Users can authenticate against the backend: e.g., logging in via the frontend results in an authorized session for API calls. Clerk middleware is functioning (tested by trying to access a protected page or API without being logged in and verifying it redirects or 401s). The backend can retrieve currentUser in server functions and use the ID for database operations (e.g., user_id is correctly recorded on a new entry). No security holes (like an API that doesn’t check user) remain.

### Video Upload Backend Logic (Est. 1d)
- Description: Implement the server-side logic for uploading and processing videos through Mux:
  - Direct Upload URL Endpoint: Create an API Route (e.g., app/api/videos/upload/route.ts with POST method) that creates a new direct upload URL from Mux. Use the Mux Node SDK (@mux/mux-node) to create an upload: muxClient.video.Uploads.create({ new_asset_settings: { playback_policy: 'public' }, cors_origin: '*' }). This returns an upload URL and an asset ID in Mux. On success, record a new video row in our DB with status “uploading” or “processing” and store the Mux asset ID. Return the upload URL (and maybe the new video ID) to the client. This allows the frontend to upload the file directly to Mux.
  - Mux Uploader Integration: (This is frontend too, but mentioning for context) Ensure that the Mux direct upload URL [9] is used by the client to send the file (Mux’s <MuxUploader/> component or a custom fetch to the URL). This keeps the heavy file transfer out of our backend.
  - Mux Webhook Handler: Create a route (e.g. app/api/webhooks/mux/route.ts to handle Mux webhooks). Configure Mux to send video.asset.ready (and maybe video.upload.error) events to this endpoint. In the handler, verify the event (Mux can sign webhooks; verify signature if possible using the Mux signing secret). On receiving video.asset.ready, parse the event data to get the asset’s ID and playback ID. Update the corresponding video record in the DB: set status to “ready” and store the playback ID (which is needed for streaming playback). If the spec says, also handle video.asset.errored events by marking status “error”. Respond OK quickly to acknowledge.
  - Notification on Ready: Within the webhook handler for ready event, after updating the DB, trigger a notification. For instance, send the video owner an email via Resend: use an email template saying “Your video [title] is ready to watch” and include a link to view it. Use the Resend API (with our RESEND_API_KEY loaded) to send this email. This is an asynchronous call; ensure not to block the response (or use background function if needed, but likely fine within the request).
  - Video Retrieval API: Though not strictly required because Next.js can fetch from the DB directly in a server component, we may implement a simple GET API (e.g., /api/videos for list and /api/videos/[id] for detail). For list: query videos where user_id = current user and return JSON. For detail: if user is owner or if a valid share token is provided, return video details including the Mux playback ID (which frontend will use in a player).
  - Vercel Blob for Thumbnails (Optional): If the spec requires generating thumbnails or storing images (like video thumbnail or preview image), consider extracting a frame via Mux (Mux can generate thumbnails via API) or letting user upload one. This can be done later; for MVP, possibly skip or use a static placeholder.
- Dependencies: Mux account & tokens; video table in DB; network accessible webhook endpoint (for local dev, may need tunneling service to test).
- Acceptance Criteria: End-to-end video upload flow works in testing: when a logged-in user triggers an upload, a direct upload URL is created and the file is accepted by Mux. After a short time, Mux calls our webhook, and our system updates the video record. The video can then be played using the stored playback ID. For testing, you can verify in the database that status changes from processing to ready and that an email (if configured) was sent via Resend (check logs or Resend dashboard). All sensitive operations (creating upload, receiving webhook) are secured (webhook validated, endpoints protected as needed).

### Implement Sharing & Notification Backend (Est. 1d)
- Description: Develop the backend for content sharing and notifications:
  - Share Token Generation: Implement an API route (POST) for sharing a video. When a user (owner) wants to share a video, they call /api/videos/{id}/share with maybe a request body containing an email to send to (or empty if just generating a link). The handler will verify the requester owns the video (check currentUser and video.user_id). Then create a unique token (could be a UUID or shorter random string). Save a record in a shares table mapping token -> video_id (and possibly who shared it, and expiration if we want links to expire after e.g. days). Alternatively, use Vercel KV: set share:{token} = videoId with an expiration (Upstash can expire keys). The token serves as the secret part of the share URL.
  - Send Share Email: If an email was provided, use Resend to send an invitation email to that address. The email template might say “You have been invited to view a video on Motion Mavericks” and include a URL like https://<app>/share/{token}. Use Resend’s API with a React email component for formatting. This can be done synchronously in the request or as a background job if performance is a concern (for MVP, synchronous is fine). If Resend responds with an error, handle it gracefully (maybe return an error to the client).
  - Share Access Endpoint: Implement a Next.js page or API that allows using the token to access the video. If using a page approach, app/share/[token]/page.tsx will call a backend function to validate the token and fetch the video. Alternatively, an API route /api/videos/shared?token=XXX can return video info (if token valid). The token lookup will check the shares store (either DB or KV). If valid and not expired, get the associated video (including playback ID). We should decide if viewing via share requires login or not – spec likely implies share links allow viewing without an account (public link). If so, we’ll make the share page a public route (no Clerk auth required), but ensure the token is unguessable.
  - Other Notifications: If there are other email notifications (besides video ready and share invites), implement those. For example, welcome email on signup (Clerk can handle email verifications by itself, but a custom welcome via Resend could be done by listening to Clerk webhook on user create). Or a periodic summary email could be triggered via a cron job (though likely out of MVP scope).
  - Cron Job (if any): Implement the backend for the scheduled tasks identified. For instance, a cron cleanup: an API route in app/api/cron/cleanup/route.ts that runs through shares and deletes those older than X days or marks expired. Use a schedule in vercel.json (e.g., run daily at midnight). In implementation, query the shares table for expired ones and remove them, or if using KV, use Upstash Redis commands to purge old keys (or rely on their TTL expiration). Test this function manually by invoking the API route locally. (Note: Vercel Cron only triggers in production, not in dev/preview, so we will test logically and then verify after deployment.)
- Dependencies: Video upload feature done (sharing builds on having videos); Resend setup; possibly KV setup for share tokens.
- Acceptance Criteria: Sharing workflow is verified: a user can hit the share API and a token is generated (record exists in DB or KV). If email was provided, a notification is sent via Resend (verify via logs or a test email recipient). The share link (e.g., visiting /share/XYZ) allows the video to be accessed (e.g., returns a playable link or page) by someone not logged in. Ensure security: the share token should only expose that single video (and nothing else). Also, verify the cron job or cleanup logic does remove or expire old share tokens if applicable (simulate an older record and run the function). All emails are being sent as expected for notifications (e.g., video ready emails, share emails).

### Additional Backend Features and Polish (Est. 1–2d)
- Description: Implement any remaining backend functionality and refine:
  - User Profile & Settings: If the spec includes user profiles or settings (like updating display name, etc.), implement an API or direct DB update logic for that. Possibly integrate with Clerk’s user update via their API if needed (for instance, if a user changes their name in our app, also update Clerk's user metadata).
  - Analytics (Optional): If needed, record simple analytics events. For example, increment a view count when a video is watched (could be done by a call to an API /api/videos/{id}/view from the player). Store view counts in either Postgres or KV (KV might be good for high- frequency increments).
  - Error Handling: Go through all backend code and add proper try/catch blocks. For instance, handle errors from Mux API (network issues), from Resend (e.g., invalid email). Use Sentry capturing inside catches to record exceptions. Ensure sensitive info isn't in error messages. Return user-friendly error responses (HTTP with generic message or specific for client mistakes).
  - Performance Considerations: Use caching where appropriate. If listing videos is heavy and mostly static per user, consider using Next.js ISR or SWR caching. Possibly use Vercel KV or the Next.js Data Cache [12] for caching expensive queries. Ensure N+1 queries are avoided by structuring queries properly (Drizzle can do joins if needed).
  - Finalize Cron and Webhook Security: Set up any secrets needed: e.g., Mux webhook signing secret in env, use it to validate incoming webhook payload. For cron routes, ensure they are not publicly accessible by random users – Vercel Cron calls them internally, but one might still secure them via a token or check a header. Possibly restrict cron route to only allow calls from Vercel IPs or require an API key (since our cron route likely isn't exposed, this might be optional).
- Dependencies: Main features implemented; possibly design decisions from spec for profiles or analytics.
- Acceptance Criteria: The backend codebase is feature-complete for MVP. Running the full app locally, all API endpoints behave as expected. No unhandled exceptions occur during normal use flows. Security checks are in place for protected routes. The team has done a code review to confirm the backend meets the spec and quality standards.

## Frontend Stage

### Implement Auth UI & Layout (Est. 1d)
- Description: Build the foundational UI pieces for authentication and layout:
  - Auth Pages: Since using Clerk, we can embed Clerk’s prebuilt sign-in/sign-up components for rapid implementation. For example, create app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx that renders <SignIn /> (Clerk component), and similar for sign-up, or use Clerk’s redirect flow. Alternatively, if a custom UI is desired, use Clerk’s hooks (e.g., useSignUp) to build forms. Clerk also provides a <UserButton /> for showing the user menu when logged in. Implement a simple header that includes the UserButton for profile/logout.
  - Layout: Develop the main application layout in app/(app)/layout.tsx (or simply app/ layout.tsx if not segregating auth routes) to include navigation if needed. Possibly a top navbar with the app name/logo and the user menu, and a side menu if the design calls for it. Use Tailwind for styling this layout (e.g., a responsive header). Ensure the ClerkProvider wraps these (already done in integration). Also consider adding a Sentry error boundary or using the one provided by @sentry/nextjs if configured (for showing user a fallback UI on crash).
  - Tailwind & shadcn Setup: Ensure Tailwind is configured (postcss and tailwind.config.js are set from create-next-app). Import Tailwind base styles in globals.css. For shadcn.ui, if not done, run the init script to install its components or manually add needed components (the project might include a components/ui directory with shadcn components). Test a simple component import to verify styling works (shadcn uses Tailwind classes, so as long as Tailwind is functioning and the theme.json from shadcn is included, it should style correctly).
  - Protected Routes: In Next App Router, create grouping for protected app pages if desired. E.g., use a segment like app/(app)/ for all authenticated pages and apply Clerk’s auth middleware to those. Alternatively, client-side, use <SignedIn> component to guard UI. Test by trying to access a page as signed out: it should redirect or not render protected content.
- Dependencies: Clerk frontend SDK available; global styling configured.
- Acceptance Criteria: The sign-up/sign-in process works on the UI. A new user can register (Clerk’s flow) and then is redirected to the app. The main layout displays for logged-in users, including a way to log out (Clerk’s <UserButton> or a custom button calling Clerk signOut). Basic navigation is in place (e.g., a link to “Upload Video” page, link to “My Videos”). Visual design is rudimentary but clear, using Tailwind classes (e.g., spacing, font sizing) consistent with wireframes.

### Develop Video Upload UI (Est. 1d)
- Description: Create the interface for users to upload videos:
  - Upload Page/Form: In app/upload/page.tsx, implement an upload form. This could be a simple form with an <input type="file" /> and a submit button. However, since we use Mux direct upload, we might integrate Mux’s provided uploader UI. Mux offers a React component <MuxUploader /> that can be used. For MVP, we can also do a custom approach: user selects a file, we call our backend to get an upload URL, then use fetch or XHR to PUT the file to that URL. A third approach: use the next-video library which abstracts a lot (but it's more behind-the-scenes and less control).
  - For clarity, let’s implement with Mux Uploader component: After user chooses file, we render <MuxUploader endpoint={uploadUrl} /> which handles the upload and shows progress. This requires obtaining the uploadUrl first – so the page might need to call our API to get one when file is selected. We can handle this by using a client component for the upload form.
  - Client Component: Create a React client component UploadForm.tsx with state for selected file. When a file is selected, call our POST /api/videos/upload route (perhaps via a Next.js server action or a client fetch) to retrieve the uploadUrl. Then render <MuxUploader endpoint={uploadUrl} /> to actually do the upload. Alternatively, if using server actions ('use server' function to handle form submission), we could pass the File via a formData to the server, but since Mux can do direct, better to bypass uploading file through our server.
  - Feedback to User: Show upload progress (the MuxUploader does provide progress events). Show messages: e.g., “Uploading... please wait.” After upload is complete, inform the user that video is processing. Possibly redirect them to the video detail page immediately (which will show a “processing” status until ready). Or display a message “Video is processing, you will be notified when ready.” If we sent an email on ready, mention that.
  - UX considerations: Restrict the file input to video mime types (e.g., accept=".mp4,.mov"). Possibly show an estimated size limit (if Mux or spec imposes one). Also handle if user navigates away during upload (perhaps warn).
  - Tailwind styling: Style the upload form or drop area nicely (centered box, drag-and-drop highlight if extra). Use a shadcn button for submission if needed, etc.
- Dependencies: Video upload API operational; Mux uploader library (install @mux/mux- uploader-react if using it).
- Acceptance Criteria: A logged-in user can go to the Upload page, select a video file, and the file begins uploading to Mux. During upload, a progress bar or indicator is visible. On completion, the UI informs that the video is processing. The user can then find the video entry (either auto- redirect to it or see it listed with status). No data is incorrectly lost or duplicated (each upload creates exactly one record). The UI remains responsive and doesn’t freeze during the upload.

### Build Video List & Detail Pages (Est. 1d)
- Description: Implement pages to list a user’s videos and to view a specific video:
  - My Videos Page: app/videos/page.tsx (or the homepage after login could serve as this). This page will fetch from the database (via Drizzle) all videos where user_id = currentUser.id. In a server component, we can use the db.select().from(videos)... to get data (since Next App Router allows accessing DB directly on server side). Alternatively, call an internal API route. But using server component is efficient: we can do something like: const videos = await db.select().from(videosTable).where(eq(videosTable.user_id, userId)). Clerk’s currentUser() can be used in a server component to get the user. Render a list of videos, perhaps with basic info: title, status (if processing or ready), maybe a thumbnail or just a placeholder image. If ready, the item can link to the detail page. If processing, perhaps show a spinner or “Processing...” text. Use a shadcn/ui Table or simple list with Tailwind styling for this.
  - Video Detail Page: app/videos/[id]/page.tsx will show the video player and details. This is a dynamic route receiving video ID. Fetch the video by ID (server-side). Verify the user has access: if the current user is not the owner and the video isn’t being accessed via a share token, deny access (or redirect). If the video is still processing, show a message or spinner. If ready, render a video player component. Mux has a React component or you can use a plain <video> tag with the Mux playback URL. For Mux, the playback URL is something like https:// stream.mux.com/<playback-id>.mu8 for HLS. We might embed the Mux provided iframe or video element with Mux data. Mux also offers a web component or their player library (e.g., <MuxPlayer>). Simpler: use an HTML5 video tag with the MP4 URL Mux provides (Mux can provide a.mp4 URL if enabled) or HLS via video element if using hls.js. Given time, maybe use Mux’s pre-built player for reliability.
  - Show video title and description on this page, and possibly the upload date or any other metadata. If spec allows, maybe allow deleting the video on this page (a delete button that calls an API to remove it from our DB and optionally from Mux via API).
  - Share Button UI: On the video detail page, add a Share action. This could be a button “Share” that opens a modal (use shadcn/ui Dialog component). In the modal, present either a generated link or a form to input an email to share with. For MVP, we can do both: show the share link which user can copy, and also an input to send it directly. Implement as follows: when the share button is clicked, call our share API (POST /api/videos/{id}/share) possibly with or without an email. On success, it returns the share URL (token). Display the share URL in the modal (in a read-only textbox for easy copy). If an email was entered, show a confirmation like “Invite sent to xyz@example.com”. The share modal UI can use shadcn form and button components, styled nicely.
  - Ensure to handle edge cases: if share API fails (network or validation), show an error message in modal. If user is not authorized (shouldn’t happen since only owner sees the button), handle gracefully.
- Dependencies: Backend video list/detail APIs or direct DB access; Mux playback info; share API.
- Acceptance Criteria: Logged-in users can see a list of their uploaded videos. The list updates (if a video was just uploaded, it appears with “processing” status, and after processing, if the page is refreshed or re-fetched it shows as ready). Clicking a video opens the detail page where the video can be played if ready. The video player works (tested on a ready video – it streams or plays content from Mux). The share button opens a modal; copying link and visiting it in another browser allows viewing (tested after implementing share page). The overall UI is clean and usable, with appropriate loading states (e.g., if DB query is slow, Next.js might show the default loading state or we add a custom spinner).

### Implement Share Link Public Page (Est. 0.5d)
- Description: Develop the page that opens via a share link (when not logged in):
  - Create app/share/[token]/page.tsx which is a public page (do not protect with auth middleware). In this server component, parse the token from the URL. Query the database or KV for the corresponding video ID. If not found or expired, show an error message (“Invalid or expired link”). If found, retrieve the video details (join with videos table). We might not want to reveal owner info if not needed; just show the video and title.
  - Since the viewer might not be logged in, we won’t show any user-specific nav. Possibly we provide a link or option like “Sign up to Motion Mavericks” as a call to action here, but not required.
  - Render the video player similarly to the detail page. The difference is we don’t require the user to be owner. If privacy is a concern, this page is effectively an unlisted view accessible to anyone with the token.
  - (If spec intended share to require login anyway, then this page could instead redirect to login and then show the video for authenticated users; but likely token bypasses auth.)
  - Implement a fallback if needed: e.g., if a logged-in user happens to follow a share link, it should still work – our page should handle both cases gracefully.
  - Add maybe a simple header or branding on this page so it’s recognizable.
- Dependencies: Share token system done.
- Acceptance Criteria: Given a valid share token URL, anyone can view the video without logging in. Tested by copying a share URL from an owner account and opening in incognito: the video plays. Invalid or used tokens show appropriate error. This fulfills the “share flow” requirement of the MVP.

### UI Polish and Responsive Design (Est. 1d)
- Description: Refine the frontend for a production-ready feel:
  - Use Tailwind to ensure responsive design: test pages on mobile screen width and adjust classes (flex vs grid, col stacking, etc.) as needed. The video player should be responsive (maybe max- width for video player container).
  - Apply a consistent color scheme and typography. Tailwind’s default is fine, but if Motion Mavericks has branding (logo, colors), apply those (update tailwind.config with custom colors, font if provided).
  - Ensure accessibility: all interactive elements (buttons, links) have appropriate text or aria-labels. For example, if using an icon button for "share", label it. Use shadcn/ui which generally follows Radix UI accessibility so modals, etc. are accessible by default.
  - Add feedback for user actions: e.g., after uploading a video or sharing, maybe use a toast notification (shadcn includes a toast system) to say “Video uploaded successfully! It will be ready soon.” or “Link copied!”. Implement a simple toast context if needed.
  - Integrate Sentry for frontend errors: the Sentry Next.js SDK auto-instruments front-end too. Verify that the DSN is set and errors like React runtime errors would be captured. You can simulate an error to test (though not user-facing, important for devs).
  - If time permits, add a loading state for video processing (maybe periodically poll the server for status if the user is waiting on the detail page). Or instruct user to refresh after some time / check email for readiness.
  - Cross-browser test: ensure the site works on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Particularly test the video playback (HLS might require Safari’s native or hls.js for others, but Mux player handles it).
- Dependencies: All features in place to polish; possibly brand guidelines if any.
- Acceptance Criteria: The UI looks professional and works well on different devices. No obvious styling issues or broken layouts. Users have clear feedback when they perform actions (upload, share, etc.). The design, while simple, appears cohesive and aligned with any provided style guidance. The application is essentially ready from a user perspective.

### Client-side Testing & QA (Est. 1d)
- Description: Before formal testing phase, do a thorough run-through of the UI:
  - Click through every flow: signup, login, upload a video (maybe use a small test video), see it appear in list, wait or simulate ready, view it, share it, open share link, etc. Note any bugs or UX concerns.
  - Fix minor issues found (e.g., form validation messages, broken link, etc.).
  - Ensure that navigating the app doesn’t produce any console errors or warnings. Address any React key warnings or such.
  - Verify that protected pages cannot be accessed when not logged in (try manually navigating to /videos when signed out; it should redirect).
  - Check the integration of all external services on UI: Clerk’s UI for auth should function (try social login if enabled), Mux upload and playback should work in browser, Resend emails – though not directly visible in UI, but maybe check that after share the system shows success (and possibly use a test email to confirm delivery).
  - This is essentially a final sanity check on frontend before moving to dedicated testing stage.
- Dependencies: Implementation complete.
- Acceptance Criteria: UI is confirmed to be functional for all main use cases. A list of any known minor bugs is compiled (and ideally fixed). There are no blocking issues preventing a user from accomplishing the MVP scenarios. Stakeholder or product owner can be given a demo of the UI at this stage and sign off before formal testing.

## Testing Stage

### Unit & Integration Tests (Est. 1d)
- Description: Write automated tests for critical backend and frontend logic:
  - Unit Tests (Backend): Using a testing framework (Jest or Vitest), test pure functions and critical pieces of logic. Example unit tests: function that generates share token (e.g., ensure correct format, maybe test expiration logic separately if any), any utility that formats data or interacts with KV (could mock KV calls). If using Drizzle, you might not unit-test DB queries directly, but you can test that certain queries (functions wrapping queries) behave as expected by mocking the DB.
  - Integration Tests (Backend): If feasible, set up tests that call the API routes directly in a controlled environment. Next.js App Router makes it tricky to test route handlers without deploying; one approach is to factor logic into functions and test those, or use Next’s built-in request simulation. Alternatively, write tests that run against a local build using something like Supertest to hit endpoints. For example, test the Mux webhook handler by simulating a POST request with sample JSON and see that it updates a fake DB (you can use a test DB or mock the DB).
  - Component Tests (Frontend): Use React Testing Library to test individual React components in isolation where possible. For example, test that UploadForm shows a file input, and if a file is selected (you can simulate selecting a file), it calls the API function (you’d mock the API call). Test that ShareModal when given a link displays the link and copy button, etc. Also test any pure utility or hook logic if present.
  - Run tests in CI: Ensure that running npm test executes all test suites and that all pass. This should be integrated into the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) so that any future changes run these tests.
- Dependencies: Application code finalized (so tests target stable logic). Dev dependencies like Jest, Testing Library installed. Possibly need to mock services (Mux, Clerk) – e.g., for unit tests, you might stub Clerk’s currentUser() or Mux SDK calls to not actually call external.
- Acceptance Criteria: All written unit/integration tests pass. Achieve a decent coverage on core modules (not necessarily 100%, but enough to catch major regressions). The tests for critical flows (upload, share, etc.) reflect the acceptance criteria (for instance, a test to ensure that when a Mux webhook payload is processed, the video status becomes ready in DB). The CI pipeline runs these tests and reports status.

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright (Est. 1–2d)
- Description: Develop EE tests that simulate user behavior in a headless browser environment (Playwright):
  - Set up Playwright test runner (install @playwright/test and maybe generate a basic config). Decide on running against a local dev server or a deployed test environment. Likely, we can run Playwright against the local dev build in CI.
  - Auth Flow Test: Script a test where Playwright navigates to the app, goes to sign-up page, fills the form, and creates a new account (if using Clerk, this might be complex without a test mode – an alternative is to use Clerk’s development instance or an already created test user to log in via UI or programmatically set session cookies). Possibly skip actual sign-up by using a pre-made test user in Clerk (Clerk allows test users via API, or use environment that allows password auth).
  - Upload Flow Test: After logging in (somehow), navigate to upload page, attach a small video file (Playwright can simulate file input). Start the upload and wait for some condition. We may not want to actually upload to Mux in a test (time-consuming and requires internet), so one strategy is to stub the network: Playwright can intercept network calls. Alternatively, if using a dummy Mux environment with a test token, we could attempt it for real but might be slow. Perhaps better to stub the API call for upload URL to return a dummy URL and then stub the upload itself. If too complex, we can limit to testing that the form appears and the API call is made. We may rely more on integration tests for the heavy logic.
  - Share Flow Test: Assuming a video is available (we can insert one directly in the test DB or use a fixture), navigate to its detail page, click share, input an email, and click send. Check for confirmation message. Then retrieve the share token from the database or email (maybe we have a way to catch the outgoing email content via Resend test API or a dummy SMTP in test). If possible, extract the link and have Playwright open it in a new browser context (no auth) and verify the video is playable or at least the page loaded with correct title.
  - General UI Tests: Also test general navigation: e.g., if not logged in and trying to go to /videos, ensure it redirects to login. Or test logout: user clicks logout and is taken to login page.
  - Use Playwright’s assertions to validate expected content on page (text, element visible, etc.). Playwright can also capture screenshots on failure for debugging (set that up in config).
  - Running these in CI might require setting environment variables (Clerk test credentials, etc.). Possibly use a headless browser with XVFB if needed (but GitHub Actions with Playwright provides runners).
- Dependencies: Application running (maybe start via beforeAll hook in Playwright using next start or use a deployed stage). Test user credentials.
- Acceptance Criteria: Key user journeys are verified automatically:
  - A test for “upload video and see it listed” passes (even if we shortcut the actual upload via stubs).
  - A test for “share video and access via link” passes.
  - No regressions: if future changes break these flows, the tests will catch it.
  - Playwright tests run in CI or at least locally with consistent results. Document how to run them for future developers.

### Performance and Load Testing (Est. 0.5d) [Optional]
- Description: (If included in spec for MVP) Evaluate basic performance:
  - Use Lighthouse (in Chrome devtools or via CI plugin) to audit the app’s performance and best practices. Focus on video page performance (should be mostly streaming, not too heavy on initial load aside from player script).
  - If needed, do a small load test on key endpoints: for example, the share link endpoint or video list API, to ensure they handle multiple requests (Neon auto-scales, so we mainly check our code for inefficiencies).
  - Check bundle sizes using Next.js analyzer (to ensure Mux/Clerk SDKs aren’t bloating too much). Optimize by lazy-loading heavy components if needed.
  - Optimize any slow queries identified (maybe not an issue with small data sets).
- Dependencies: Completed features; possibly a staging deployment for realistic environment.
- Acceptance Criteria: The app scores reasonably on performance audits (Lighthouse scores etc. are acceptable for an MVP, e.g., no severe issues like huge unused JavaScript). The backend can handle at least moderate concurrency (like multiple simultaneous video uploads – tested by perhaps uploading small videos at once). If any performance bottleneck was found (for example, unoptimized images or redundant re-renders), fixes are applied. Task: User Acceptance Testing & Bug Fixes (Est. d)
- Description: Conduct UAT with stakeholders or a small group:
  - Provide the deployed MVP (or a staging link) to stakeholders for acceptance testing against the spec. They will go through each requirement to ensure it’s met.
  - Collect feedback and any found issues. These might include: functional bugs (something not working as specified) or UX issues (confusing text, etc.).
  - Triage and fix critical issues discovered. Minor issues that are not MVP-critical can be noted for a future patch, but anything that affects core functionality or quality should be resolved.
  - Ensure after fixes that all automated tests still pass (update tests if the fixes changed behavior).
- Dependencies: A stable build deployed to staging or accessible to testers.
- Acceptance Criteria: Stakeholders sign off that the product meets the spec Rev B requirements. All critical bugs from UAT are resolved. The MVP is now ready for launch from both a developer and user perspective.

## Release Stage

### Prepare Production Environment & Configurations (Est. 0.5d)
- Description: Set up all configurations needed for a smooth production launch on Vercel:
  - Ensure all environment variables are set in the Vercel Production environment (and Preview if needed). This includes DATABASE_URL (likely Neon’s prod database URL or use Neon’s integration to automatically supply it), NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY (use production keys from Clerk dashboard), MUX_TOKEN_ID, MUX_TOKEN_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY, SENTRY_DSN, any KV or Blob related tokens (Vercel might manage those automatically when enabling the feature).
  - Set up the Vercel project if not already: link the Git repository, choose the correct root folder (if monorepo), etc. Configure build settings (by default Next.js should be auto-detected).
  - Add the vercel.json file to the repository with the Cron jobs schedule (if we have cron tasks). Also include any rewrites or redirects if needed (e.g., maybe ensure all share links go to the share page, but since we used /share/[token], that’s direct).
  - Configure domains: if Motion Mavericks has a custom domain (e.g. motionmavericks.com), add it in Vercel and set DNS. If using just Vercel provided domain for now, that’s fine.
  - Make sure the Clerk auth settings include the production domain in allowed redirect origins. Also, Resend domain verification should be done (so emails aren’t sandboxed).
  - Sentry: ensure the DSN is correct and the release is identifiable. We might set Sentry’s release version (e.g., via an env var or in build command injecting SENTRY_RELEASE).
  - Toggle any feature flags: e.g., if using Next.js experimental features that were only for dev, adjust for prod if needed.
- Dependencies: All secrets and config values at hand; Vercel account access.
- Acceptance Criteria: The Vercel project is fully configured for production deployment. All environment variables are in place (double-checked), such that a deployment will have everything it needs to run. No runtime secrets are missing (which would cause crashes). The custom domain (if any) is set and SSL will be handled by Vercel.

### Deployment to Production (Est. 0.5d)
- Description: Perform the initial production deployment:
  - Merge the final code into the main branch (if following Git flow). This should trigger Vercel deployment. Monitor the deployment logs for any build errors. Next.js build will run, ensure that Drizzle migrations run (depending on setup, we might run migrations manually on Neon or incorporate in build – could use a migration step in CI).
  - Once deployed, run smoke tests on production URL: open the site, try basic actions (we might create a test account, upload a very small video, etc.) just to ensure nothing behaves differently in prod. Check that static assets are loading, etc.
  - Verify that Cron jobs are registered (in Vercel’s dashboard, see that cron job appears as scheduled). Also verify Blob and KV integrations if applicable (e.g., does our Blob upload work on prod? Possibly do a quick avatar upload test).
  - Keep an eye on Sentry for any error spikes on prod after launch. If any come up, address them quickly.
  - Performance check: test page load from a different region or incognito to ensure no obvious issues (like something that worked locally but not with CDN or serverless environment).
  - If everything looks good, mark the deployment as the live release.
- Dependencies: Successful build in CI; Production config done.
- Acceptance Criteria: The Motion Mavericks MVP portal is live and accessible at the production URL. Core features function in the production environment as they did in testing. The team verifies that a real user can sign up, upload a video, and share it, end-to-end on prod. All monitoring systems (Sentry, etc.) are running without critical errors. Stakeholders are notified that the MVP is deployed.

### Documentation & Handoff (Est. 1d)
- Description: Compile necessary documentation for maintaining and operating the MVP:
  - Developer Guide: Write a README or dev docs covering how to run the app locally, how to run tests, how to deploy (though Vercel is CI/CD, mention any manual steps like running migrations if needed, or seeding data if applicable). Document the architecture briefly and any notable decisions (for future developers).
  - Operational Runbook: Document how to handle common operational tasks: e.g., how to roll back a deployment (Vercel can rollback to previous deploy easily), how to scale the Neon database if needed, where to find logs (Vercel Functions logs, Sentry for errors), and how to handle expired credentials (like rotating Mux tokens or renewing Resend domain if needed).
  - Security Checklist: Note any important security tasks to regularly do, e.g., update dependencies for vulnerabilities, review Sentry alerts, ensure data backups (Neon has point-in-time restore, but mention enabling it if not default).
  - Feature Flags or Config: If any part of the system is configurable (not much in MVP likely), document it.
  - Account Access: List where the keys are stored and who has access. For example, note that Clerk dashboard is used for user management, Mux dashboard can be used to see videos/ stream data, etc., so that ops team knows where to look if an issue arises.
- Dependencies: Product fully implemented; team knowledge to capture.
- Acceptance Criteria: Documentation is written and shared in the repository or internal wiki. It’s up-to-date and accurate to the final system. A new developer or ops engineer should be able to read it and understand how to run or troubleshoot the MVP. This documentation step is complete when the team lead/CTO (or relevant stakeholder) reviews it and confirms it covers the necessary points.

### Post-Release Monitoring & Support (Est. ongoing, initial setup 0.5d)
- Description: After launch, ensure the team is set to monitor the platform:
  - Set up Sentry alerts for critical errors (e.g., if any error happens more than X times in Y minutes, send an alert to email/Slack).
  - Ensure someone receives notifications for failed Cron jobs or other automation (Vercel might notify if cron invocation fails).
  - Establish a process for user feedback or support queries (perhaps outside technical scope, but mention if relevant, e.g., support email connected to Resend? Or just manual).
  - Plan a review after a week of launch to go over analytics: check how many signups, uploads, any performance issues, etc., to validate system performance.
- Dependencies: Live traffic (if any).
- Acceptance Criteria: Monitoring is active and the team is promptly alerted to any major issue in production. The system remains stable in the initial post-release period, or any issues that arise are documented and scheduled to be fixed. This marks the completion of the MVP execution with operations in place.

## Ops & Security Stage

### Ongoing DevOps and CI/CD Maintenance (Est. 0.5d)
- Description: Finalize the CI/CD and devops setup for maintainability:
  - Ensure CI pipeline runs all tests on each PR and on main merges. Possibly add an automated deployment to a staging environment on main merges (could use Vercel Preview as staging).
  - Set up Dependabot or similar to keep dependencies updated (especially security patches for Next.js, etc.). This includes updates to Next.js, Clerk SDK, Drizzle, etc., when available – testing them in staging before production.
  - Implement backups for critical data: Neon has bottomless storage and branching for backups, but it’s wise to periodically export data or create a branch as a backup. Document a schedule or automated job for backups if needed.
  - Check resource usage and quotas: e.g., Neon free tier limitations, Mux minutes of video, Resend monthly email count. Set up alerts or at least a plan to upgrade if usage nears limits.
  - Optimize build and deploy process: e.g., if build times are long, consider caching or removing unused libraries. Next.js can do incremental static regen for some pages if needed (not heavily needed here except maybe marketing pages).
- Dependencies: CI runs in place; accounts with monitoring (Neon etc. often provide project usage stats).
- Acceptance Criteria: The engineering team is confident that the automation around testing and deployment will keep the project healthy. Any contributor can run tests and deploy changes with minimal friction. The system is resilient against stagnation (dependencies won’t go unpatched).

### Comprehensive Security Audit (Est. 1d)
- Description: Perform a security review of the application now that it’s complete:
  - Dependency Audit: Run npm audit and check for any vulnerable packages. Address by updating or patching. Given our stack is relatively modern, likely fine but always check.
  - Penetration Testing (basic): Simulate common attack vectors:
    - Try accessing APIs with invalid or missing auth tokens to ensure proper 401/403 responses.
    - Try URL manipulation (e.g., sharing a video ID that doesn’t belong to you through the UI – ensure the backend check prevents data leakage).
    - Test for XSS: since we might render user-provided video titles or descriptions, ensure we escape output. With React and no dangerouslySetHTML, we should be okay. But confirm e.g., if a user can put script in title (most likely Clerk or our forms can sanitize or at least it will render as text).
    - Check CSP and security headers: Vercel/Next sets some by default. Ensure no obvious misconfig (we might add helmet or Next’s config to strengthen if needed).
    - Verify that content uploads are validated: ensure only certain file types and sizes are accepted to Mux (Mux by default will reject non-video, but we should enforce file input filters too).
    - If using NextAuth instead of Clerk in some scenario, ensure secure cookie usage, etc. (We used Clerk, so it manages session tokens securely for us).
    - Privacy considerations: Confirm we are not inadvertently logging sensitive info. For example, ensure that if Sentry’s sendDefaultPii is false (unless we want it true). The Sentry DSN is fine to be public, but secrets should not leak anywhere.
    - Infrastructure Security: Check that only necessary ports are open (with Vercel serverless, this is managed). Clerk and others are SaaS handling sensitive data. Neon is secured by user/pw and sometimes IP rules; maybe enable Neon’s encryption and authentication enforcement.
- Dependencies: Deployed app; tools like OWASP ZAP or just manual checks.
- Acceptance Criteria: No high-risk vulnerabilities are found. Medium-risk issues, if any, are ticketed to fix or mitigated quickly. For example, if XSS was possible in a certain field, we fix it by escaping or removing that input. The app complies with common security best practices for an MVP. We document the security measures in place (this can tie into the documentation task).

### Monitoring & Observability Setup (Est. 0.5d)
- Description: Make sure we have insight into the running system:
  - Sentry Tuning: Verify that Sentry is capturing both client and server errors. Organize Sentry issues (set appropriate environment tags for prod vs dev). Set up alert rules (like alert if error rate > X). Also consider enabling Sentry Performance Monitoring if needed to catch slow DB queries or slow page load traces. Possibly enable Session Replay for the frontend to replay user sessions for debugging (Sentry has this option if needed).
  - Logging: Vercel function logs can be viewed in dashboard, but if we need more, consider integrating a log management. For MVP likely not, but ensure we use console.log in moderation. If something critical happens (e.g., cannot connect to DB), it should log or send to Sentry.
  - Analytics: If product wants some analytics (user count, video count, usage frequency), set up a simple tracking. Could just rely on database stats or add a tool later (out of scope for MVP, unless spec included something like PostHog or GA).
  - Cron Monitoring: As noted, Vercel Cron doesn’t run in dev, so we rely on it just working in prod. If a cron fails, perhaps Sentry will catch the error if we wrap the cron code in try/catch that logs to Sentry. Alternatively, use a service like Cronitor (but probably not needed for MVP).
- Dependencies: Sentry account, possibly external monitoring tools if needed.
- Acceptance Criteria: The team is confident that if anything goes wrong in production, they will be notified and have the information needed to diagnose it. For example, if an exception is thrown in an API route, Sentry logs will show the stack trace and user context. We have basic metrics to ensure the system’s health (like maybe number of signups or uploads, via either manual DB check or an admin dashboard to be built later). Observability is deemed sufficient for this stage of project.

### Performance Scaling & Cost Monitoring (Est. 0.5d)
- Description: Though an MVP, plan for scaling if usage grows:
  - Neon is serverless and auto-scales connections and CPU; confirm that it’s on a suitable tier (free tier might have connection limits, we can upgrade if needed when user base grows).
  - Vercel functions scale automatically, but ensure our usage of external APIs won’t bottleneck. Mux can handle scaling of video encoding, but note cost: track how many minutes of video are processed (Mux pricing). Set up usage alerts on Mux if possible to avoid surprise bills.
  - Resend email costs: monitor how many emails send, ensure within free tier or budget.
  - KV and Blob usage: Upstash (for KV) [11] has certain request limits, as does Blob (pricing per GB stored and transferred). We should keep an eye (maybe monthly) on how these scale with usage.
  - If needed, add a simple admin monitor page for internal use showing counts (number of users, videos, etc.), to gauge growth.
  - Also, ensure that adding more content won’t degrade performance: e.g., if one user has videos, our list page should paginate or lazy-load. Might not implement now, but note as future improvement.
- Dependencies: Running system, knowledge of service limits.
- Acceptance Criteria: The MVP is prepared to handle an initial user base comfortably, and there are plans or at least awareness for scale. No immediate scaling issues appear in testing (e.g., app can handle at least tens of concurrent actions). The team has cost dashboards for Neon, Mux, Resend, etc., to monitor usage. The system should scale up in the near term without refactor (vertical scaling via service tiers if needed).

## Summary
By following this execution plan, the Motion Mavericks team will systematically build the MVP portal from groundwork to a production-ready release, covering all key aspects: backend, frontend, devops, and quality assurance. The plan ensures that authentication, video handling, sharing flows, notifications, and observability are implemented with best practices using the chosen modern stack (Next.js App Router, Clerk/ Auth.js, Neon, Drizzle, Vercel Blob, Mux, Resend, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Sentry, Vercel Cron, KV, Playwright). Each stage defines tasks with estimates, dependencies, and acceptance criteria to track progress and verify completeness.
